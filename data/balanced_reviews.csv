"these leggings ripped within hours of wearing them.  Right at the crotch too...not something I would order again.  On the positive side, they are super soft, but that does me no good if they rip...",1,197
I wish I could return these masks.  The M/L size isn't realistic for a man.  The material is thin and cheap.  The ear straps pull on my ears.  Oakley face masks fit better and made of better material.  Buying sports masks outside of Amazon.,1,240

I am beyond happy and satisfied with this product! It is true to picture. I am super excited and can’t wait to see the person receiving its face.,1,145
It's not that hard to measure and get sizes right. The chart is not accurate and for workout clothes fitting is important. Do better.,1,133

"Too tight for upper arms.<br />Probably best fitted for a teenager, not an adult",1,80
"Chain was in 3 pieces, no extra battery as promised. No damage to package. The snitch itself is cute so if you don't mind locating batteries and a new chain... not a bad deal.",1,175

Shorts are a lot bigger than specified almost pant length,1,57
"The material is like a cheap, 90's swim suit. The dress itself it too short to be a dress, too long to be a shirt, and not the right cut to be a tunic.",1,151

Wont stay up and want a refund,1,30
Turned out to be unusable junk. Don't buy and look elsewhere.,1,61
"Far too large, they are baggy but not baggy enough to be the proper baggy slouch kind of beanie you see people wear.. the crown of the beanie has a point to it where the fabric was a sewn together. Rather a ugly big lose beanie. Even after washing. I have absolutely no plan on wearing this.",1,291
After 1st wash in a cold water it shrank 2 sizes!,1,49
"I’ve had for 10 minutes, it’s already broken. Pin came out and I’m trying to piece it back together. Description said it was white, it’s not white, it’s gray. Disappointed to say the least.",1,189
Outfit is too big and has loose threads! Not worthy money,1,57
Lenses were actually falling out.,1,33
These masks do not come with a nose wire as advertised. They came with a strip of plastic. I don't know if that is supposed to be the nose wire. I am so disappointed. No value.,1,176
I was looking for something for my kids to wear during this pandemic vs a mask. The material is very thin.  They feel like the same material as a dry fit t-shirt. Slightly sheer when stretched a bit.  I am not sure there is much protection with this.,1,250
I bought 2 shirts.  The first one was fine.  The second one was cut very different.  More like a mans shirt.  Way to small from the waist on down.  whitejo3240@gmail.com,1,169
"I'm average shaped and these did not work at all! Super bummed, the fit so weird.",1,81
Not as baggy as one would think. Fits like a nylon stocking.,1,60
These are super comfortable however the leather stretches and then your left with deformed shoes that you can no longer wear.,1,125

"La mascarilla es cómoda, muy elegante y de una marca relevante. El problema está en el alambre de ajuste en la nariz. La usé solo durante 2 días y el alambre se partió. Ya no la puedo usar, se nota que la pieza está rota, y no permite sacarla sin romper la mascarilla.",1,268
"I got the mask on 9/30.  On 10/3, the mask started malfunctioning by showing partial of the image.  It shut off and never came back on.  I tried charging it, but it stopped working and won't turn back on.  The battery is taped inside it and cannot be charged.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!",1,282
Not same color as shown. Not worth 10$.,1,39
Must be from China . Sizing way off . 3x felt like a Size small. I'd show you the video of me trying it on but Amazon would flag me for indecent exposure because the bra covered nothing,1,185
Sizes run very small - about 2 sizes smaller.,1,45
This is a waste of time and money,1,33
Came with loose stones and the chain portion looks horrible.  definitely get what you pay for,1,93

This bracelet is very poorly made. It broke after two days.,1,59
The dress is very thin and the red roses started to fade when a drop of water touched it,1,88
I order 2 40 Pcs sets. When they arrive not only were there only 30 in each set but another 10 in each set did not work....pay for what you get I suppose.,1,154
Very small. I got two sizes bigger but it was still to small,1,60
"This is a very different material from most nylon underwear. It is a much larger weave and seems awkward for underwear. No cotton lining in the crotch area either, so they are not a good option healthwise. Would NOT recommend.",1,226
"Jacket was too small, hood was too small to fit the head. Hood wouldn't buckle and pull string snapped right off, no movement at all too tight on shoulders",1,155
Sizings are way off. The large size was too loose for me and will even show my boobs out. Its just way off. All the other i bought in amazon that are size large are ok though and fits me.,1,187
Don't waste you money!,1,22
"Felt like paper towel material and had random chunks of other colored threads sewn into the seams. Get what you pay for, I guess.",1,129

Incredibly cheap product it’s literally made of ribbon and is<br />Ugly.,1,72
"They were very nice when  I first got them, they fit perfect, the material is kinda thin, and a bit see-thru, but I liked them, after washing them I hung them to dry, no dryer, and they still shrunk shorter and smaller. Not good, can't wear them anymore :( very dissappointed",1,275
I was not impressed! I am tall and slender  5’8” and 140 and I ordered a medium. It was too wide and too short!,1,111
"However, on cool days it did keep me somewhat warm. Washed by hand and flat drying destroyed the material (woolite).",1,116

Pants run a bit big in body and dont hold their shape. They also run very short.,1,80
I ordered a size 16 it wouldn't even go past my thighs so it was probably more like a size 12. The dress did look somewhat well-made but upon return I never received my refund and had to pay for shipping,1,203
"I bought this as a Valentine’s Day gift for my boyfriend, and not even 2 months later there are holes in the seam of the shoulder! Poorly made! Waste of money! Of course it’s too late to return! I’m so stinking mad. Not to sound like a cliché...BUT....If I could give 0 stars I would!",1,284
Very small. Doest fit my wrist. Backlight is very dim and you cant tell the time in the dark.,1,93
This watch is definitely and $8 or I would say even less than $8 I feel like I got ripped off because it look like it came out of a quart of gumball machine,1,156
Waaaayyyy too big for my wrists. Returned the set!,1,50
The photo is accurate for once and that is the problem.,1,55
"Metal money clip inside wallet came out.. Sadly, this wallet is built like junk",1,79

Product arrived with a dead battery; returned it.,1,49

The colors are dull and not bright AT ALL like it  is pictured. The top is baggy and fits horribly. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,1,122
Cheap looking and feeling.,1,26
They were much shorter then the picture shows. I expected them to be longer.,1,76
Seller is very nice to work with.  But this item is so thin you can see through a double layer!  The item description needs to be updated to reflect this fact.,1,159
"If you do not use it all quickly it goes bad and no longer works.  The container lets in too much air/moisture.  Spoils in about 1-2 months.  I use very little at a time so metal ""paint can"" style container works best.  Metal container I got over a year ago and still fresh.",1,274
These things fill apart as soon as I started using them on my keychain. I use them to clip my keychain to my purse so I would never be without them. It’s broke several times and I’ve glued it back but I think I’m done with them and probably will need to come up with something else.,1,282
Too small for my plus size arms 😟. I'm very disappointed... I have plus size arms...  Perhaps if I was a size sixteen they would fit. Not my 20+ size arms.,1,155
I purchased the white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner and it was extremely see through. It’s hard to even put anything under it to help because the cut outs on the dress are high and almost everything under it shows. I’m sure it would be cute in a darker color.,1,266
They are much lighter colored than in the picture and the sizes don't match. I got these plus when I was at a 6 gauge and they were way too big. I'm now at a 4 gauge and they are still too big. I'll never buy from this seller again.,1,232
"Thin, cheap, tore day one.",1,26

"Earring is super cute and fit in my daith perfectly, but it didn’t latch closed so I lost it within a day. You get what you pay for",1,131
This product feels cheap and looks cheap.  It's the type of thing you know if you touch it too much it will start to discolor.  I'm actually going to return them this week.  Not worthy.,1,185
"This came in today and was not the color advertised. It was baby with a blue stripe, where it pictures a black mask with a blue stripe. It's also made extremely thin and you can see right through it.",1,199
"NOT A SWEATSHIRT !<br />More like a thick nylon t-shirt.<br />Classic dishonorable, lying from a CHINA manufacturer of very poor product.",1,137
"The earrings showed up and they were filthy, the silver was actually more like brown/gray and I had to wash all of them and scrub them to make them look halfway decent and then they were impossible to get clasped after I opened them up to put them on. I would not buy these again.",1,280
WAAAAAY too small.  I wear a standard US 1X (18/20) and ordered a XXXL according to chart conversion.  I would say it was maybe a XL.  But you get what you pay for I suppose.👎🏼,1,176
Don't know why I wasted my money. A cheap towel accomplished the same results. Really unhappy with this purchase.,1,113
"My experience with this product was very brief, so it's hard to have to come with twenty words describing my history with this product. I got this case and the zipper broke the next day this product sucks!",1,205
"When I bought this case it was not labeled as a 6 Plus case. I made sure I ordered one for a normal iPhone 6. This is completely useless to me and I am out $8.00<br />They have since changed the description to say 6 Plus, what a scam.",1,234
"I ordered the 6 mm plugs, however I can't get them in my ears as the flare is huge! The flare is around 8 mm, not great if you don't have much stretch in your ears.",1,164

Very narrow,1,11
These sunglasses are horrible. The lens keep popping out and the wood side pieces are weak.,1,91
I purchased these boots in gray and sand.  The gray boots were good.  The sand boots were not.  There was visible glue between the sole and the upper.  The upper was wrinkled as if the lining was improperly applied.  The tongue was especially wrinkled.  I would not recommend these.,1,282
Shirt was way too wide,1,22
Flimsy and didn’t last me very long,1,35
"Definitely not 4 way stretch,  tight in the knees when bending, strange soft but slick material, no structure to the waist band! Slide down and I have no tummy! Going back!",1,172
The printed image was not centered on the shirt.,1,48
Bag is ok,1,9
Box came very damaged. I was not impressed with this watch in any way,1,69
"I’m not sure why these were not true to size for me, like the review. They were very small. I saw they were from China, I ordered xxxl. I am a size 16. I couldn’t even get them over my thighs. Not for me.",1,204
"This is supposed to be a tunic and it’s more like a long sleeve T-shirt on me. I bought a large, I’m 5’8” 185lbs. Way, way to short and it’s snug also.",1,151
It looks like a mumu without shoulders. It’s literally hideous.,1,63
I can not rate this item because I never received  this necklace. Hoping to get it soon.  I wanted for a gift for Christmas for my niece  I went out and got her something else. Hoping I get it for her birthday that is coming very soo,1,233

One of the stones fell out after 2 months and I emailed the company and got no response.,1,88

Xxl fits like size medium,1,25
Came missing a button,1,21
Terrible sizing! I ordered a size xl and could not even get my arm on the sleeve due to its tight fit (I am a size 14). This is going back!,1,139
They are very big.,1,18
typically wear a 10/12 large - this shirt is super small across back and chest- sleeves are only part true to size- also very short does not even come to my hips - only 5'5&#34; tall,1,182
Not at all like pictured. Very short and boxy. Not flattering whatsoever.,1,73

The dress doesn’t look anything like the photo it looks like a shirt,1,68
The colors run.,1,15

It don't look nothing like the picture. .,1,41
"Title pretty much says it all.  I could see flesh color through the whole dress, and when I looked down, I realized I could see the floor through it.  The yarn that was there seemed reasonably thick, but felt scratchy to me.  No thanks.",1,236
Gross!!! Dress was clearly worn!!! Tag was cut off... Dress was bunched up and wrinkled in the bag! Bought this for a funeral. Had to scramble last minute to find something something else! Thanks for checking your products before sending them out!!!,1,249
Runs VERY small. Stretchy material though. Ships from China so beware of sizing. You get what you pay for.,1,106
Arrived dirty..,1,15
This picture shows with a crown but I received just the lion head no crown or diamonds in the eyes,1,98
These pajamas are paper thin and the fit is extremely small.  It literally sounds like you are wearing paper pants when walking.  One pair has already fallen apart in the wash.  I will not be buying these again.,1,211
Does not look like what is pictured! Piece of C@#p,1,50
This product was cheaply made. My daughter wore it once for a dance class and it has a rip in the seam of her left leg.....very disappointed 😞,1,142

You get what you pay for...,1,27
"This item took a very long time for me to receive it.  It is so small, the details are lost. I could not tell it was a skeleton hand when I tried it on; so I don't see the point in wearing it.",1,192
I received this necklace a couple days earlier than the estimated delivery time. The latch is stuck and can't be opened. It is a beautiful necklace and I am very disappointed that I can't wear it. There is no option to contact the seller  so I can't return it.,1,260
it’s a pretty hat but the sizing isn’t for men’s ... and it arrived warped..! not even my niece’s head it fits!,1,111
"Avoid these boots. Purchased less than a month again, worn on weekends only. Holes in the same place in both boots.  Clearly a manufacturing design problem",1,155
way to thin cheaply made do not like big waist and small thighs. material feels weird against my skin.,1,102
"I like the look of the earring but the post in the back is very thin and broke the first time I tried to wear.  Very disappointed. I will try to contact the seller for a replace,ent.",1,182

Has a terrible chemical odor I can't get rid of.,1,48
The band on this ring is so thin that it is uncomfortable to wear. Much thinner than it looks from the picture.  Otherwise it's an ok ring. Ruby is pretty murky with many many inclusions.,1,187
I got the suitcase for my daughter for her international trip. It did not survive the one trip. Already on the first flight it broke. I know that airport personnel don’t handle each bag with care. But it should have lasted longer than one flight. Super disappointed.,1,266
If you were a large don’t buy a large fit to tight,1,50

VERY CHEAP SHOE,1,15
cheep product it is very cruddy. and irritating on the skin,1,59
I ordered this 4 pack of shirts labeled large. Two of them were a medium at the absolute largest. There is a clear discrepancy in size between the correct shirts and the ones too small. The box also arrived open inside of the Amazon packaging. Very displeased,1,259
Plugs chipped and the emblems fell out rather quickly.,1,54
"What a joke, I got white cropped top with tinsel which looks nothing like a photo, tinsels are very short the top is barely covering my breasts and I'm a skinny person. It's very short, cheapest quality. Not worth $1",1,216
"The measurements should be reversed. Its about four feet wide, but barely long enough to cover your midriff area, let alone a swimsuit. Not like the photo. Looks very weird on. No way I can keep it or pass it to someone else. I was really looking forward to wearing this because the photo is great.",1,298
Looks brassy and I'm sorry i bought,1,35
Definitely not good when you need something a right size and even return and add in comment that wrong item was sent and I still receive the wrong item again 2 more times. Very pretty dress but not when it’s too small to wear.,1,226
It did not fit properly and the necklace was cheap and damaged.,1,63
"Came with one of the spikes broken off. If these are delicate enough to break during shipping, I wouldn't recommend wearing them.",1,129
Not cotton at all. One of the 4 pics says 100% cotton. Amazon why have u lowered your dtandards,1,95
"It’s cute, but for me it was a bit too tight. Also, the 2nd time I went to put it on, it snapped & beads went everywhere :(",1,123
The style is great.  The quality of the frame is not.  I have had three pair and on each the temple breaks off by the ear.,1,122

Super cheap thing material. Just feels wrong. Didnt even put them on.,1,69
Such thin material that the posts bent and the back of the earrings and the unicorns were digging into my daughter's ears causing a terrible infection. The back of her ears were starting to grow over the back of the earrings and it took over a week to heal.,1,257
Not very supportive for a larger bust.,1,38
this is the cheapest bracelet i have ever bought.  it dosen't tighten and the strings just got loose and it just hangs on the wrist.  would never buy again.,1,156
"I have a big head ....  this visor is a better fit for women ,  small men and kids...",1,85
Just received item with a hole in it!,1,37
I was excited to get this. I needed for a bracelet I had. I was so disappointed when it broke right away. The clasp broke and the only way I could use it was to open the one ring and then close it with oilers.,1,209
The band doesn’t have support to stay on it keeps falling off,1,61
The material is awful. It’s like basket ball shorts. Reminds me of the “roll of shirts” in Idiocracy. This shirt is garbage.,1,124
Went to finally use my Christmas gift. Had it all charged and ready and did not even work. Would not heat up. So bummed.,1,120
Not a thing to like about top unless you like the color. Pants okay if you already jave a top you can wear with them I do notl,1,126

These socks are of such heavy duty compression  that it is nearly impossible to put them on yourself. The material is such that it grabs lint like crazy.,1,153
I don't know how this dress has gotten good reviews. The fabric is so cheap looking!!!!,1,87
They quit working after a week. Their junk. Dont waste your money.,1,66
"I usually wear a large in pants because of my butt, but after reading the reviews I ordered 1 size up and the pants was still too tight annnnnd short. Very disappointed. Will have to give it away because to return would be a hassle. My height btw is 5""5' 169lbs 37/35/49..",1,272
Was not a man's size.,1,21
"Cheap material used.. Came torn upon arrival<br />Not worth the price, returning it..<br />Won't buy from this company again.<br />Also has a starchy feel to it.. Its pretty, but not for me.",1,190

Color was different from the description,1,40
"Overall, a pretty crappy mask!  Bought much better masks for much less!",1,71

It's wasn't look like the picture,1,33

Nylon was tough and the principal behind the belt is good but the design is absolutely ridiculous. Neither buckle end will go through belt loops so there’s no point in having the quick snap buckle. Terrible for everyday use.,1,224

After one wash the decal fell apart,1,35
No shape to dress and icky material.,1,36

"Shorts are significantly larger than shorts of a comparable size, the quality is atrocious as the seam in the crotch has split after the first wear, the pocket isn’t tight enough to hold anything in place.

The image on the shirt is not at all as the picture shows it should be.,1,71

3rd time washing them they started ripping. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. They were comfy though,1,101
This is crap. The beads all turned green after one day and it is extremely difficult to open and close. Usually have to use pliers.,1,131
This dress was garbage. The fabric was thin and the dress was sloppily thrown together. It is a wrap around with no way to tie it. I returned mine.,1,147
"Was not sent full items as described, no dark brown was sent. Only light brown and black. Please resend the correct items or issue a refund thank you!",1,150

It was very hard to separate it and put it back together and the size was way to big for my ear so it was really uncomfortable and made it red.,1,143
Just bad was money,1,18
It is not exactly like the item in the pic. The contrasting colors on the fabric is not the baby blue print as it is in the picture. The dark blue stones look more like navy than royal blue.,1,190
Do not buy this if you’re expecting what’s in the pictures. What came in the mail was a Tshirt material. It’s not a sweater material at all. it’s very cheap in the way it feels and looks. Do not buy. Falsely advertised!! If I could give 0 stars I would.,1,253

"The sling lasted only for 5 days, poor quality.",1,47
"It was made of parachute pant material.  Sounded very noisy when trying on, couldn’t even imagine wearing them out in public!  Way to big in every way.  I’m 5’1 & 115  lbs and ordered a small.  The label read small, the fit was more like a roomy medium.",1,253
Feels like sandpaper.,1,21

Son loved them when he opened the box... but after 2 months. And about 10 wearings. Three of the lights have gone out resulting in a very unhappy boy.,1,150

Very VERY frail and fell apart when opening the package.,1,56
"This is the worst item I have ever ordered. I am in complete shock. It is just material sewn into a huge shapeless, uneven smock and a black shoestring in the bag. Talk about a deceptive description. They should be ashamed of themselves selling this junk. Don't waste your money. Returning!",1,290
Size was not at all accurate,1,28
Too thin. The adjustable strap slips so it doesn’t tighten correctly.,1,69

8 pair were broken.,1,19
I ordered a mounted canvas reproduction of &#34;The Lovers&#34; I got a rolled-up inkjet (or something) print that was weirdly altered and whose colors were wildly off.,1,168
This dress was pretty when it arrived although a bit larger than I had hoped. I wore it once and the seams in the dress just disintegrated one by one over the course of the evening leaving gaping holes that had to be camouflaged with a jacket.,1,243
This looks like a one piece it is not.  It comes with black underware thing.  The sizing is way off.,1,100
I waited so long to get these pants and they are the absolute worst!!! No idea who's legs the manufacturer was thinking were going to fit in these.  WOW  so bad.

Unfortunately this top is very unflattering..ordered my usual size and fits me huge. The straps are super stretchy so they fall off my shoulder.,1,144
Cheap quality. Not worth what I paid for them. They don't cover my eyes almost at all.,1,86

VERY THIN ... I RETURNED IT,1,27
It did not fit at all for the size chart. I usually wear a size medium and the size chart suggested I buy an xxl so I did and it was sooo tight and uncomfortable fitting.,1,170
xl is like an xs.  fine for a child.,1,36
I preface with I have bought many of this brand in the sane size with no issues... These were cut weird and smaller than normal Rae Mode sizing. Really strange. I also had to pay to return them myself even though it's an obvious error in manufacturing.,1,252
son lentes que pueden ser muy utilies en la nieve segun mi experiencia personal e incluso en lugares como elk  que vivo con neblina pero en la ruta no hacen diferencia. Con luces de frente no ayudan y con lluvia no hace a la diferencia,1,235
Falsely advertised as compression socks. They are nothing but cheap material that only goes up to your calf.,1,108
Super this fabric,1,17
Screw that hold the Ford F-150 came out and lost it. This was after only having it on my keys for about 2 weeks. Now I just have the ring with no f150. I'm not hard on my keys so I expected more from this.,1,205
cheap - cheap - cheap. the seam between the side and cargo pockets split on both sides and the fabric is full of pills after two wearings,1,137

This was not at all that the picture showed! Very disappointed!!,1,64
The fit was awful,1,17

Not well made and not flattering  at all. I am returning.,1,57

Came with 3 giant holes in it! Horrible product cheaply made.,1,61
"I ordered the black and white shorts with horizontal and vertical lines and i got totally different shorts, the lines were only vertical. Anyways, theyre totally different shorts. I would give 0 stars if i could.",1,212

Definitely not worth buying and returning,1,41
Very cheap quality and the color is off.,1,40
"Looks better in the picture, the stones are not put on well, crooked, uneven,  and not even sparkly at all, good for kids playing dress up that's about it.",1,155

sizing is off! not even close to what is published. too small!!,1,63
I returned this item. I couldn't get the individual key holder to accept the key. If you can't get the key on - what's the point of having it?,1,142

This product was way to small I even ordered a size bigger,1,58

The water bladder leeks at the hose connection,1,46
"Not at all what I expected, looked and fit nothing like picture. I wear a so 14 and this was not flowy. Material very thin, sewn poorly and had no give at all. Would require ironing back it went",1,194
The Material started to pull after wearing it for a week. Poor construction. Sometimes you get what you pay for,1,111

would have been cute if it was sewn together correctly,1,54
Horrible clip.. bites the skin and slides off the bra strap.... useless...,1,74

"Ordered this because it was mentioned as highly adjustable. I’m a 46ddd and this didn’t fit at all. Couldn’t even get it on to zip it up.<br />Material was much more flimsy than I expected. I thought it would be a thicker material for support, but it’s like a satin stretchy material.",1,284
"These are NOT pink. They are gray, with just a little pink on the straps.",1,73
Received a dress with a broken zipper that's unwearable. No help offered when I wrote in about it. Huge waste of money.,1,119
To soft of material,1,19
"It is very obvious it is plastic. I thought the rose would look like antique white, giving it the vintage look that it advertised. Instead it is butter yellow & very cheap looking. I got what I paid for, but not what was described.",1,231
Broke after two days on a rear view mirror,1,42
The single most uncomfortable footwear I've ever had the misfortune to experience. Ouch! My advice: look elsewhere.,1,115

Too expensive and looks ugly,1,28
Love the ring but when u dont take off finger turns green no good,1,65
Returned poor quality,1,21
These earrings are nice and light but they open and fall off very easily because the hole is much bigger than the thin hoop. I wish I could return them but I am past the returning period allowed!,1,195
I have has this for less than 2 months and the zipper has already broken. Also the padding inside has been shedding out of it since I received it.,1,146

Absolutely LOVE the shirt BUT once I opened it to try it on it was a small hole in the underarm area. Super disappointed,1,120
The product was not as pictured. The colors weren’t the same and poor quality. Definitely not worth the $22 more like $10,1,121
"Runs very small. Strange design, odd fit, weird length. The material is like swimsuit material. I'm 5'7&#34;, 135 lbs, 36D. I ordered a medium. I generally wear a size 4 in dresses. This fit however the top was stitched strange, the length and drape was weird. I'm returning this dress.",1,286
"[[VIDEOID:ce9d89611658966d1b56a88eb9cb5298]] Looks like trash, like something from a home printer that you iron on",1,114
I have been told by many hair stylist that my head is small and this bonnet is very tight. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing it but it’s so small it makes my head hurt.,1,182
"DO NOT BUY THIS COAT THREE DAYS AFTER WEARING MY ZIPPER BROKE,WHOEVER MAKES IT MAKES IT CHEAP NOW IM OUT 40 BUCKS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A QUALITY COAT,BUY BEWARE",1,169
The color is more grey than plum in an ugly way. The zipper fabric is an odd pink color. The straps are too short on the one attached upon opening and way too long with the strap included inside the bag. This purse was a huge disappointment.,1,241
Although it is a beautiful it runs really small and i mean really small. I ordered a 3X and couldnt pull it down past my chest.,1,127
Cheap quality and color,1,23
WAY TOO TIGHT AROUND THE NECK,1,29
They are long enough for my 35 inch inseam but after only having them on for an hour the lace top separated from the rest of the material.  very cheaply made.,1,158
"From a distance, it looks pretty, but if you get close the quality of the fabric is bad and the dress itches the skin, and the worst thing is that the underwear is transparent!",1,176
These are so cheaply made!! They were not Capri length and they were huge around my ankles!!! I ordered navy blue Capri and got black long length. Will be returning,1,164
Halo ban broken - l wings stuck together.  I would not recommend this product.,1,78
"TERRIBLEEE!!! it is nothing like the photo, does not even reach the waste..... it is not loose like it says.... it is a fraud",1,125
Not happy with this jacket at all.  Wish I would have returned it!  Very thin and just hangs really weird.,1,106
"Not at all what I ordered! I bought the same dress in 3 different colors and I got 3 different fabrics and shapes. Only one (Black) was as described, which was great, but the other were dinky fabric with thread hanging from every seam and the dress had no shape!  beware!",1,271
"This is not the color of the item!!!!!!! We have looked at it in the sunlight, led flashlight, bright room light etc. it is a dull blue gray from any angle. Beware!!!!",1,167
"Sizes are way off, I ordered a XL and it was like child sizes",1,61

The hands of the watch are so small that it is very difficult to read.,1,70
"Not linen, not the same color and small",1,39
"I believe it was the 4th or 5th time i was wearing it, it just smapped... not what i was hoping for ...",1,103
The right glove broke after the second time my boyfriend used them.,1,67
"As you can see in the picture, the waistbands of the panties differed by a lot.  Since the elastic was not very ""soft"", I could see this being a real comfort problem with the smaller waistband. I returned them.",1,210
I made this a one because it’s cute. Never got to wear it because the zipper broke the first time I tried it in. I bought an xl and I wear a size 8 so it’s not Because it was to small. I bought it for on the boat to share with people. Won’t<br />Be suggesting this to anyone,1,274
I'm sending it back for credit. The fabric felt cheap and the it's short and wide cut.,1,86
You see red and blue stripes that cause a headache,1,50
I ordered 4 pair of these goggles.<br />2 out of the 4 broke during the first use.<br />Bummer,1,94
Washed these one time and they started to rip along the seam.  Very cheaply made,1,80
Had to rip out and completely replace lining within two weeks in order to keep using purse. Don't waste the money.,1,114
"These are super cute but sad to say they do not fit well at all. Very loose around the nose, like it is not shaped correctly to really even cover the nose.",1,155
I’m sure these are for a child’s arm.<br />-Britt,1,49
I used this bag for two days before it ripped in my suitcase.,1,61
"Should be stated as, infant earrings. The clasp was not able to hold without damaging the gold. Very displeased and sent item back.",1,131
"Not sterling silver, it's nickel. I knew it wasn't silver from the price, but I figured at least the posts would be stainless steel. Nope, almost had to go to the hospital due to infection.",1,189
"Junk. The little pair is so little that it wouldn’t fit a newborn. And the bigger pair which is tiny, terrible quality. One broke while trying to put it on.",1,156
It was a Christmas gift  and within the first two days the necklace part had to be replaced and the tooth / claw broke when it tapped on the counter sitting it down,1,164
Material was itchy and size down. Purchased smallest size but had to return was still almost 2 sizes big cute dress though!,1,123
I think the XL is actually an XS.,1,33
This is obviously not a mask to be used for protection. My wife purchased this for me because I love BTTF but it's not a mask to be worn. It's more just for memorabilia purposes.,1,178
"La calidad del producto es terrible , se ve como un collar barato, no lo compraría de nuevo",1,91
The clasp broke within days.,1,28
Very thin and cheaply made. I’m sending it back.,1,48
The first time I wore one of the belt it immediately broke apart and continued to break apart throughout the day. Super cheap but I guess that's what you get when you buy something like this.,1,191
Cheap easily falls a part. Ends are made of plastic glued on. Made in China.,1,76
The band was good quality. But I don't like..,1,45
It literally twisted upwards on me with every step,1,50
"Blurry graphics, cheesy material. Reminds me of a Mylar balloon. Probably will never wear it.",1,93
These are very small and seem to be made from old handset cords. I know no one buys phones with cords anymore so I guess they found a way to repurpose them.  Not the best decision.,1,180
Very tight fitting. I actually got ride of them.,1,48
These pants didn’t fit like the ones in the photo at all; they were way too baggy all around and didn’t get slimmer at the calves,1,129
The right shoe zipper broke the first day I wore them out. Other than that the shoes were cute up until then. Buy these if you don’t plan on walking in them. Cheap is cheap for a reason sometimes.,1,196
Faker than a 17$ bill. NBA emblem guy was short and wide. The name on the front by the Mitchell and  ness sign looked like a 2nd grader sewed it onto a piece of felt,1,165
The outfit has really nice colors but it is so super thin and looks nothing like the picture,1,92
Only lasted a few weeks then it began to fall apart. Not well made.,1,67
"Very lopsided unfortunately. Not sure the point of it being made like that, but unfortunately I didn't use it until the day of Halloween so I had to make my daughter wear it anyways.",1,182
Returned it didn’t like the fit,1,31
I am a very small slender person who barely weighs 100 lbs so when I put these on and in less than 10 minutes they were so tight the circulation in my arms was gone and both hands were numb!  I gave them to my 4 yr old great granddaughter  so she can play with them with her dolls.,1,281
I only received one and paid for 2 !!,1,37
I don't hate the polish; I hate that it is the smallest bottle of nail polish I have ever seen.  Had I known that it was not a regular size I would have never purchased it.,1,172
Inexpensive for sure. Small and tight fit. Might make it through a few days of wearing.,1,87
Laces shown are clearly all gold and the other pair are all silver.  What arrived today were one pair that were BOTH gold and silver.  We can’t use these!,1,154
They send the worst item that they had in stock and it split on the first use because being natural the wood was already damaged 💔,1,130
My son wear 9. I ordered 9.5 just to be safe and that felt like a 7. My recommendation is that you do not even buy this product.,1,128
Had it on a front zipper pull of a work bag - purely decorational. The ball of flowers fell off within the first week. Waste of money.,1,134
These are useless because lens pop out easily and frequently,1,60
It gives the appearance that it is long and flowy but it's extremely short in length for my height.,1,99
"Like the title says, these don't fit into the frames correctly. They rattle/move around in the lense frames. Sadly, they fit like they cost...cheap.",1,148
I have metatarsalgia and thought these would be great.  They did fit well and stay on but the seam was thick and burned my soles so much that I had to take off after an hour of wear both times I wore them.,1,205
These photos advertised the rings to be shinier than what they are. I'm extremely disappointed.,1,95
"horrible, doesnt fit on ears, painful, breaks easy.",1,51
"Didn't fit, too tight in bustline and armpits.",1,46
This shirt was beautiful but unfortunately  I had to return it because a 2x was sent and I needed a m...,1,104
It’s too small. The bands are not long enough.,1,46
I ordered xl and got a large but this thing is still huge!!! Very weak stitching and not flattering at all. I won't be wearing it. Super cheap,1,142
The screw driver doesn't fit the screw on the neckless and couldn't open it. How can I open with this big screw driver for small screw?,1,135
"VERY DISAPPOINTED. The fabric that lines the sole of these lifted within two months of purchase, making them look so gross. Not to mention the fabric and footbed are both like sponges for foot odor and sweat, so these shoes will have to be replaced. Now.",1,254
Broke instantly,1,15
"Very thin material, cheap belt, and way to long.  If you do not have hips or a butt, this is not the product for you.  Needless to say, it was NOT the product for me.",1,166
I received two shirts (instead of a shirt and a pair of pants). One of the shirts had a huge stain.  Super gross!!!,1,115
The shirt is cut to short and it is not a true 3x.. For the money this shirt isn't even close to being worth the price.  Walmart has better shirts...Drake needs to really review this product,1,190
"The stones were more white than blue, the ""gold"" appeared black. I was very disappointed. I will return these even though they were just for my 12 year old daughter.",1,165
[[VIDEOID:1faad5350c5106250a1016db00a5d6d4]],1,44
"Do not buy!!!, I bought this shirt and it wasn't delivered. However they increased the price and I could buy it again. Buy at your own risk!!",1,141
horrible quality. Too short.,1,28
So I ordered this dress because I was in need of a green plaid one for work. I received the dress today and it’s blue instead of green. You also can barely see the black lines. It’s like it’s almost grey. Very disappointed in the look of it compared to the pictures on here,1,273
Cheap garbage broke as soon as I tried to tie it.,1,49
Worse than the 3D free glasses you get at the movies. And only big enough to fit a 5-year-old. Waste of money and time.,1,119
These pants look terrible! They looked like jeans but they're just silky with cuts and run big on my daughter.,1,110
too small. very thin material. will rip if pulled on with just enough force to put on the foot. waste of money. stick with target store brands.,1,143
Does not have the chain closure detail shown in photo and fit is strange. Returning,1,83
The leggings came with a huge rip across the back,1,49
Horrible. Way too big for anyone’s face. Even tried to wash it to see it would shrink and that still didn’t work.,1,113
These arrived broken!,1,21
It turns my finger green,1,24
I am sending it back,1,20
"The color was pretty, but the material is super thin, hope Good will likes it",1,77
Even though I ordered a small it was still very large. I do not believe I was given the right size.,1,99
Never received this!,1,20
Its a size or two smaller and it isnt padded. Also said it was amazon prime and was not. Highly disappointed and dont recommend,1,127
"Liked the way they fit, design etc but broke after one week of wear. I took them off my head and the side snapped right off. I guess you get what you pay for",1,157
So small and tight. Not even close to standard sizing.,1,54
Went to put it on and has holes in it! So disappointed,1,54
"Stones where missing, not happy with the quality",1,48
Beautiful dress but you have to be tall in order for it to look like one the model. I a 5'2 and I ordered a Medium and it was very long and big on the back.,1,156
Literally broke in in three places within less than 1 hour of the first wear.,1,77
Aweful fit. I even bought 3x for him because I saw it ran small. It’s more like a size small,1,92
"too small, doesn't fit on my ear anywhere.",1,42
This ok,1,7
"The size I ordered was accurate,  but the fitting was way too small. Cannot wear.",1,81
Muy incómodo,1,12
These broke one day after I recieved them,1,41
"DON'T BUY THESE, THEY ARE THE CHEEP THINGS AT THE MOST EXPENSIVE COST. I have purchased other EAGLE EYES products and the QUALITY was very very GOOD these are worth about $5.00 MAX they don't fit the head the ear arms are to close they charge $39.00 or more VERY POOR QUALITY.",1,276
"This is tighter than the regular ""hospital"" type masks.  Got them to use at the gym, no way would I be able to breathe with this on",1,131
Lied about the fabric. Bad business.,1,36
Right hand is tore,1,18
"A very cheap looking bag, everything about it just screams low quality. I am shipping it back.",1,94
Dropped it once and it busted into multiple pieces.,1,51
"This item did not fit properly, too short, and you have to request a label from the vendor. The vendor sends the return label, but you are responsible for the return shipping back to China. The lowest return shipping I could find was approximately 58.00 USD.",1,258
The dress is like a dead man chest tooooo heavy and large call write it cost as much as purchases the dress as to return it,1,123
Not warm.,1,9
"So thin it doesn't matter if you wore complimentary underwear these pants are paper thin and see through, the only way you can get away with wearing them is if your top is long. These are going back",1,198
They fit loose on the back of my feet and the left pedal has a pop at 6 o’clock. It’s driving me nuts. We’ve tried adjusting them and the bike shop said they were junk..,1,169
Is is flimsy and huge<br />But comfortable,1,42
"I drive long haul buses, thought this would help, but it made the sun to bright, headlights that weren't bright originally were now glaring.  plus i drive thru no where roads, no light.  Had to return them",1,205
returning it,1,12
"This could have been and amazing dress if it was made out of a non sheer material, like cotton. I'm heartbroken because it was otherwise perfect.",1,145
It was beautiful when I got it than it changed color which indicates it is cheaply made,1,87
Very tight fit especially in the hips where I would have wanted it to be loose. Not true to size.,1,97
These are so cool but they broke in just minutes after putting them on. :( really disappointed,1,94
"This is not an infinity scarf. It is just one big piece of material that could never be worn as infinity scarf, cannot even wrap around my neck once.<br />Need to find out how to return this!",1,191
Wore these for one day and realized they're stripped so they won't stay on. They literally come unscrewed and fall off. Don't waste your money,1,142
The front was printed on the back and vise versa.  Sent back for a refund.  My daughter was very upset.,1,103
Ordered a medium and it fits like a XL or bigger.,1,49
Normal retail suggested price for a Chinese made KN95 is less than a U.S. dollar!,1,81
My child doesn't like it... it tickles the extra strap won't stay in place flops all over. The yellow nose clip broke in half the first time it was tried on.,1,157
The good: the material was lovely. The bad: if you have hips or a tush the draping gets weird and you look like your wearing a plus sized loin cloth or a diaper. Not cute,1,170
sizes are HUUUUUGE,1,18
Terribly cheap fabric and totally different from the picture,1,60
These are very chincy. Cheaply put together and every single one of them fell apart within a week of putting them on her shoes!!,1,128
Did not represent the size I ordered.,1,37
"I received this shirt today. As soon as I removed it from the package, I smelled body odor. The shirt smells strongly of it and has clearly been worn before. The shirt itself looks nice but it smells so badly I did not try it on or look at it closely.",1,251
"Ohhhh, no....I didn't know &#34;PU Leather&#34; meant PLASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!  I feel so foolish.",1,93
[[VIDEOID:e255cafb625d48d825630c3fa79b16f3]] Just return my money and take your cheap product back,1,98
Way too big not the right size,1,30
Not flattering and shows every dimple if you are not wearing shapewear underneath. It is a very stretchy material and thin. I wore them for five minutes and then donated to Goodwill,1,181
They look and feel cheap.  Definitely not made for chicago weather.  I would not buy them again.,1,96
Cheap gold painted plastic,1,26
always wanted a hoodie like that but it fit very weirdly on me (I'm a petite girl with big hip). Didn't like the material either so I returned it.,1,146
"Had these for 2 weeks when a stone fell out. They are useless, now.",1,67
These headbands are not for babies. They are for toddlers and girls.,1,68
Product is defective.  The handle broke after carrying the handbag approximately 6 times and was pass the return date.  I'm stuck with a handbag that is unable to be carried.,1,174
Way to small this should be for a 5th grader not an adult woman,1,63
"Everything about this was wrong. its made with very cheap fabric. It has no shape. The cardigans that are pictured together with this with lines on it, are made from different fabric and fit much tighter than expected",1,217
Not helpful.,1,12
THIS IS FROM CHINA A CHEAP PEICE O CRAP NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED - THIS IS A PENNY ITEM @ BEST-GOOD LUCK,1,102
Don't buy this blouse.,1,22
I use them as hankies because they are too thick to wear as a bandana. Not only that I think you would have to have a head the size of a basketball for this to fit comfortable,1,175
"I normally wear a size 6-8, or medium. I bought a large, thinking it would be nice and loose, like the photo, and it was tight like a fitted, small t-shirt. Very disappointed.",1,175
"They looked like a comfortable shoe.  When I got them, they were not.  They also looked very cheap.  Not a good buy.",1,116
I ordered a 2x can't even pull it up.  ordered 2 pair.  won't again,1,67
"Nothing like the picture,disappointed and it fits big.Its actually a Leggings made from spandex type material.size chart misleading,wish I didn't buy",1,149
"I bought this patch thinking it was a better quality. I was wrong, the patch I received is not what is pictures. And shipping & handling charge $14.<br />I'm really disappointed.",1,178
I am a small adult and can not get it over my hand. This might fit a 5 year old hand.,1,85
Item was so cheaply made of polyester material and the headbamd was just a strip of cloth. I got a refund though they said I could keep it. Won't let my daughter wear it so probably will drop off to Goodwill.,1,208
I bought an XL and it is more like a small,1,42
"I read the reviews and ordered a large even though I'm normal a size 4. I am very disappointed: the material is cheap and sheer, they are about 3 inches above my ankles, it took forever for them to get here, nothing like the picture. They are going in the trash.",1,262
"Cute but too small. I knew I was taking a chance but it's smaller than I thought it would be. Lesson learned, go with gut.",1,122
"Liked the style, feathers too large.",1,36
This dress is not like the pinkish/red dress in the picture. It came shipped CRIMSON red!! That’s not what I was expecting at all...,1,132
They look cheap and were very uncomfortable.,1,44
"I received the wrong bathing suit , not the one that I purchased, the one on the picture . So disappointed.",1,107
Loved it but can't wear it because the clasp won't stay on. Very disappointed,1,77
Too small. Not good quality,1,27
Fit is weird & uncomfortable,1,28
Band broke after just a few days of wear. It fit my wrist loosely so I definitely wasn’t stretching it much to put it on. Unfortunately I’m unable to order a replacement as the item is out of stock.,1,198
Very stiff and smell horrible. Small fit. Not very comfortable. Instructions are in Chinese. Not sure I should wash it or not.,1,126
Was not satisfied with this at all. The box was mangled and cheap looking for the price I paid for it and it has blue color in the watch that is not pictured. I didn’t even want to give one star for this. I would have sent it back but apparently it was too late.,1,262
The purse came broken but otherwise this purse is a beautiful purse! Doesn't look cheap either.,1,95
"Whatever is on these made me,my mom, my wife all break out with a reaction that looked like and felt similar to poison ivy/oak  NOT WORTH IT",1,140
Awful for $ broke within minutes.,1,33
Ripped down the front when I received it,1,40
"If you are purchasing this dress, size up.  Also, the fabric is thin for the yellow floral pattern and see through so keep that in mind when purchasing.  This dress was not for me.",1,180
I don't even want to give this one star. I received a totally different coat than what is pictured.  Very thin and lightweight.  I ordered an XL and it fits like a small.  The customer has to pay for returns which is not worth it. Worst item I've ever purchased from Amazon.,1,274
"Disgusting! Awful quality, wrong color, doesn’t look like in the picture!",1,73
Demasiado chica,1,15
The material is terrible. It does not fit loose as it appears in the picture. I did not return it because there was no paperwork included in the package. Money lost!,1,165
Didn’t come in my size but kid size,1,35
This fits a 10 year old child.,1,30
This is a cotton top that is very plain and does not look like the picture.  I waited weeks for delivery and was not at all satisfied with this product.,1,152
Fits more like a shirt and the fringe came all apart on the bottom and is ruined,1,80
Piece of crap made in China.,1,28
I bought the largest size to have it lose. It was like an extra small bottom and an xxxxl top. The sizes didn't match up,1,120
Came today way to short to even wear.,1,37
[[VIDEOID:3b498dca6f67920a2cd324ede594a09b]] Arrived broken,1,59
These are tights not leggings. They arrived with loose strings and damaged material as well. Returned and will not rebuy.,1,121
"I was given a refund which I appreciate.  They are not stones but GLASS!  One even had an imprinted logo in another language on it.  Very poorly made, chipped and broken glass was all they were.  Grateful they were refunded",1,223
Doesn’t fit around my neck or wrist. Waste of money don’t buy this,1,66
"Not polyester, not able to sublimate on it with they’re directions. Making temp higher melts the fabric. Worst product I ever ordered and received!",1,147
"This is a beautiful gown and the fabric is soft, however when I received it the left strap was broken",1,101
The bras were flimsy and a couple of them had holes from moths(?). I returned the same day I tried them on. There was no way they were high impact.,1,147
"This top too small,pretty  color and style",1,42
"My daughter is 16, tall and 120 lbs. We got this for ballet practice and it was WAY too small for her. It would fit her 5 year old sister just fine on the biggest setting and her teddy bear on the smallest setting. I loved the way it was made and it's of good quality for sure but just way too small.",1,300
Did not work at all on my frames.  Threw them away.,1,51
"Way to much $$ for what it was.  Looked cheap, not good metal, thought it was 3D but was flat.",1,94
"Ordered my size and they were too small.  If you order, order them at least a size larger.  Unfortunately, the most popular sizes have very limited selections, or not available at all. Skip these and buy a different brand.",1,222
To Tight Around My Waist,1,24
"Mine was not true to size. I wear a size 8/10 and it felt a size smaller. The chest area did not lay properly and didn't keep things ""in"". Loved the color but will be returning .",1,178
Sizing is off big time and buttons fell off in package,1,54
"Total rip-off. As you can see, they show you three bunnies, and the size and price reflects the expectation of receiving three bunnies; as does comparing prices of bigger chocolate bunnies.<br /><br />Guess what? No returns/refunds! A $7 1.5 oz bunny is unacceptable.",1,267
My glasses still get foggy.  If they r supposed to work then they should have instructions with it.,1,99
This dress was waaaaayyyyy shorter than expected. It was not a maxi at all.  Returned!,1,86
i expected the watch band soft and comfortable. It did not meet my criteria. That's why the price was so cheap. You get what you pay for.,1,137
This was missing the white gem.,1,31
Fits much boxier than pictured--returned for a refund.,1,54
"too small, kid size",1,19
Was not the skirt pictured. I received a tan and white at the bottom skirt. Clearly not as advertised!!!!,1,105
The top was unveiling,1,21
the clasp does not close.,1,25
That says it all.  Why would you not have several sizes? Not everyone is made the same size.as you know...,1,106
This is the second band I ordered and it was not as pictured.,1,61
They broke in one day,1,21
I loved this but it broke 3 days outside of return period.,1,58
"Very low quality material, and the garment looks like it’s children’s size.",1,75
"did not return mone back ,I return it.",1,38
"the back looks funny , crazy large zipper dident go with the outfit",1,67
I'm giving this one to stars because the color they have is all of but it's actually a dirty khaki. I am returning,1,114
Size 8 - 10 is at least two sizes smaller than it should be.,1,60
This item was made of poor material. Really very poor and cheap! I've brought other product and the quality was totally different. I can feel their difference the first time I toughed them.  Don't buy this one! It doesn't worth you even one penny!,1,247
The cut of these are not good. You butt hangs out.,1,50
"I decided to take a chance even though other reviews already said they received deformed hats. It would've been cute, but arrived unwearable and fully bent. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.",1,192
"Overall nice product, but the loop to pull them on broke with in the first few wears.",1,85
They just don't stick to my cap.,1,32
"I really love these earrings, and when I got them, I could tell one of them locked better than the other. I was hoping I was just being a little dramatic and put them both in but within an hour lost the one that had the weaker clasp :( $50 down the drain in less than an hour.",1,276
Did not hold up well in the wash. Very thin fabric.,1,51
Looks beautiful but runs extremely small I wear a large they sent me 2X and I still couldn’t button these shorts up. Waste of my money,1,134
"I'm 5' 1&#34; , small frame weighing 101 lbs.  This shirt is extremely tight and small on my body.  I can't imagine how it would fit on a larger person. Unless you are an elf, forget buying this shirt.",1,201
Hole in one pocket. fits snug. Zips on wrong side for men.  returned,1,68
It broke on first use,1,21
Very bad quality. Not like the photo.,1,37
"I received this item Saturday and as soon as I tried to place it over my wrist that same day, the band broke and beads flew everywhere. I have purchased other beads from sites on Amazon and never had this occur. I requested for a refund the same day. To bad because I really liked the look of it.",1,296
"Too tight in the chest area, the chest seam splits the chest in a weird way, do not like that part- it’s basically unwearable for me. Too bad because the rest of the dress is cute and well made.",1,194
Tabs break off,1,14
Horrible!!  Not even close to picture!  Certainly wish I would have seen all reviews before ordering as it appears we all got the same tiny shirt vs. Long cute sweater in the picture.,1,183
Cheap looking. You get what you pay for with this.,1,50
They suck.,1,10
Wouldn't recommend buying this unless your built like a nine year old child. Cheap fabric looks nothing like it did in photos. Waste of money.,1,142
"Item is completely see through, and I ordered in black. AND arrived with a hole. Material is unbelievably thin.",1,111
"This dress came very late. It was ordered in early March, and due to come April 7th... It came on April 16th. The fabric was very thick and heavy, it felt like a weight on my lower half. The corset back was broken as well. I would not recommend this as a prom dress.",1,266
Band breaks easily.,1,19
"I absolutely loved this dress at first. I liked the way it fit and the fact that it had pockets. However, the first time I washed it, it came put with a rip that could not be easily sewn. Not worth it.",1,201
So small. I have a size 32 width chest and I could barely squeeze into this. It’s cropped too. Maybe it’s a size large for a child? I was excited about this sweatshirt but now I’m super disappointed!,1,199
Broke after a few uses. Flimsy...cheaply made. Previously I had a small clipper on my key chain that lasted 10 years!!  I do not recommend this item.,1,149

It really is a piece of junk.,1,29
They were pretty see through,1,28
The lenses popped out the first time I wore them.,1,49
"The shirt looks longer on the model, it is shorter than expected. Also, the color is way off. The ""burgundy"" is just red. Not a wine red or dark red, just pure red.",1,164
Simply Uncomfortable.....,1,25
"The sizes are so wonky I have no idea which to buy, the quality was surprisingly okay but it's not great. Way too hard trying to figure out what size you'd be. I read so many reviews before purchasing and still didn't get the size right.",1,237
If I could give zero I would. I got these earrings and really loved them. But the backs would NOT stay on. I ended up losing one of them. So if you buy go ahead and get you a different set of backs! Do not use the ones these come with,1,234
They are pretty long for “capris” I would put them more at a 7/8 legging length. They attract a lot of lint too. They are definitely see through and the bottoms have come unraveled with only owning a month.,1,206
Most of them arrived broken,1,27
I ordered two shirts from this company they were a size xl dryed them and now they’re a toddler size medium. Not happy with my order at all !!,1,142
"These do not darken or lighten depending on light, they stay the same grey, not photo sensitive at all.",1,103
Ordered a 2T and received a 4T,1,30
Dress took forever to get here .. almost thought it was lost in transit. When I finally got it it was cheaply made and not like the picture.,1,140

Very dark. Not the color shown.,1,31
"The material is cheap, and thin!",1,32
Seams at bottom of legs fell out.,1,33
Turned my finger green after wearing for only half an hour,1,58

"Returned,bulky",1,14

"don't like the material and how see through it seems, but you get what you pay for.",1,83
Bad clasp... returned,1,21
Did not fit Oanly 20's. Dont waste your time,1,44
Material is too thin and the chain was too short. You can bend the ankh. I've returned the product.,1,99
The middle gold heart isn't even gold like the listing said it was. It doesn't look much like the listing picture at all. Disappointed.,1,135
"Do not order these. They overall buckles are so cheap, they won't stay hooked. The overalls keep falling of my child.  He wore them once and we couldn't keep them up.  Sorry, I cut off the tags and let him wear them.  Wish I had gone with a name brand pair.  Save yourself $20.00 and don't buy.",1,294
It broke before I put it on. You can tell it was made in China. And i could barely read what was on the band.,1,109
"I'm returning this item<br />Description of locket says cat paw is engraved<br />IT'S NOT<br />Also, it's supposed to be sterling silver but there's no sterling silver stamp anywhere on locket and it doesn't look like sterling silver",1,233

"Bad product, the product is very thick and almost maked me feel bigger than before",1,82
"Bought for a last minute event, didn’t even end up wearing. Hideous. Looks cheap and weird.",1,91
Arrived broken. Cheaply made and cheap looking. You get what you pay for.,1,73
Opened the package and the writing was already torn. I am going to exchange for another pair and hope it doesn’t have the same issue!!!,1,135
"Sizing was about 2 sizes off, runs small. And so so short.",1,58
"These run very big.  And thr elastic is flimsy, they dont really stay on well, because they are too large and the elastic is thin and not very well made.  I am totally disappointed with this purchase.  I guess that's what I get buying underwear online lol.",1,256
"After reading the reviews and questions, I was optimistic that these might work for a 9 yr old girl. That wasn't the case, too big.",1,131
All hype,1,8
"Overall, it was easy to order, but that is the only good thing.  The seller has failed to send clothing items and it discourages one to order any clothing on line.",1,163
Go size up,1,10
Just don’t buy,1,14
Estan bonitos pero de mala calidad,1,34
"Design rubbed off case within a few days of use, I returned and received a full refund. It's a shame because it is very cute!",1,125

Poor quality material. I returned it immediately.,1,49
No me dejaron nada<br />No ha venido el artículo ya van dos veses q asen lo mismo,1,81
Got it wrong size!,1,18
"When I got it the case doesn't fit the glasses. I don't use the case, also the case isn't white and black it's brown and black which I don't like. Then after a two weeks of having the glasses they broke. So  I'm not a fan of it.",1,228
"Poorly finished.  Stitching around entire apron was haphazard and unattractive.  Length was just too, too long.  Returned this item.",1,132
"There's zero bust support - it's just a stretchy, short undershirt. The fabric isn't soft, it's actually a little bit itchy and carries static. The bottom rides up to just under my bust... this happens with no other shirt I own (not even stretchy undershirts). It's just super uncomfortable.",1,291
No idea what this is made of for allergies the print is extremely flawed probably sending back since I purchased 6,1,114
"Cheap scratchy material, will be returning.",1,43
Very pretty but way too large. Plan to purchase the same color but in a smaller size.,1,85
Material wasn’t the best quality,1,32
"These pants look literally like something you'd find when cleaning out your attic. The fabric is flimsy and poorly sown. Save your money. I got the blue, size S.",1,161
"It's sad to see that this is a really nice watch,and it doesn't work. The problem is that it's always behind. How can you waste people's time on selling these types of junk online",1,179
"Too small, cant even wear it, and can't return it.",1,50
It had a strong smell. I bought large and was still small to wrap around. So I have to donate :-(,1,97
Nothing,1,7
"I ordered a size 11 and they are a extra long size 11,plus they are a lighter color than shown, almost a light orange. Would not buy them again.",1,144
"I'm a pretty average size woman (160 lbs, 5'6, a DD breast size and ordered this in a L.)  It was so unflattering and tight in the chest.  It seemed flimsy and showed every roll.  No thank you.",1,193
Junk. Cheap plastic.,1,20
Pass on by this hat! It came smashed in a tiny bag. Way to small!! I am extremely disappointed with this hat. Color was a lot more faded then the picture it looks like it was worn for several years definitely not new! No response from seller either.,1,249
bust sizing not correct,1,23
Came tiny nylon sleeves. Was listed as 100 percent linen,1,56
It was too cheesey,1,18

"When II received the Tshirt , the graphic was coming off. I could not exchange it, I was only aloud to return the item and get my money back.",1,141

They tore a hole in them the first time I wore them and the crotch bagged down all day. Don’t waste your money!,1,111
Does not work.,1,14
These do not fit as well as other brands and have already started falling apart. My husband has only had them a few months.,1,123
I ordered plus size as I wear 14 and they did not fit at all. Going back. Too small.  :(,1,88

"super light weight, but does not catch sweat. Super thin, cheap material. Not idea for strenuous workouts. Black one fit well, white one was way too small",1,154

Wayyy too small for Medium.  Does not fit.,1,42
Very thin and a lot smaller than expected.  Would not buy.,1,58
this was a joke how do you call it X-large when the cup size fit a A cup lady never again,1,89
Made of cheap plastic like leather.... don’t recommend at all. The front fit my daughters foot weird as well. Looks much better in advertised picture than in reality,1,165
The bracelet I received is clearly not .925 sterling silver. It looks like it's plated. I am very disappointed with this purchase. Sterling silver doesn't fade red when it's dirty,1,179
I liked the style of it but very thin didnt fit well zippers are weak...,1,72
All the lettering started peeling DURING first wear!,1,52
"I used this for the first time today.  It broke within 15 minutes of use.  Won't stay open, won't stay closed.  The worst.",1,122
I cannot give a true review of this dress because I received a completely different dress that looked nothing like the Fire Kirin Women's Ruffles V-Neck Ruched Cocktail Club Evening Party Falbala Bodycon Dress.,1,210
Basically children's size and thin won't waste money again,1,58
"The STITCHING IS POORLY DONE , came off/ SEPARATED on the FIRST WEAR around the lower arm.",1,90
Not what I expected but could have been me not reading the description,1,70
Jacobson Hat Co. shipped a hat very different from the description.  There was also no adjustment strap as shone in the picture.<br />I returned the product  for a refund.,1,171
These break like a condom that been in a wallet for 10 years. Crap! Don’t buy.,1,78
It was very disappointing because the length and fit was not how it looks in the picture. And bad quality material.,1,115
"on the description, it said it will fit 4 days worth of clothing but there is no way... way too small.",1,102

Ripped and arm strap fell apart the 7 day of use.,1,49

Cheap material and the sizing is WAY off! I ordered a 3XL for my husband who is 5'8 180 lbs because the reviews advised the smaller sizing. Well it fits like a small/medium at best and feels like a long sleeve t-shirt,1,217
Had an order to the fabric,1,26
It was extremely thin and cheap feeling,1,39
"Followed sizing chart but too big. I suppose if you're straight up and down it might look good, but I m not so it doesn't.",1,122
These are not sublimation.,1,26
"The zipper fell off when I tried to zip up.  I ordered the XXL and could barely fit over my shoulders, I'm 5’7”.  The pockets fell mid-thigh.  The white was covered in black smears.  This is trash. Returning!",1,208
"After one wash in cold water, the length shrunk 4.5 inches. The width remained the same.",1,88

broke by the second day of use made with cheap material but only paid 10 bucks can't expect much i suppose.,1,107
The product was faulty and came damaged. Communications were ignored. Something for the kids to play with them throw away,1,121
"The pendant broke off the first time she tried to put it on and we were unable to repair. It was cheap, but no value for your money If you never get to use it",1,158
Snaps broke after a month of use. Contacted company and haven't received any feedback.,1,86
"Cute bathing suit, unfortunately I couldn’t even fit 1 boob. I am a 32 DD and got a medium, and it was way too big in the bottoms and way too small up top",1,154
"Print is super cute, but the material is cheap. Almost feels like a Halloween costume. Material is very thin.",1,109
love the color and pattern but my first one fell apart after a week. second and third was missing part of the pattern. not worth the hassle,1,139
Really poor quality!! Bought one  and it broke within two hours. Replacement broke within two weeks.,1,100
"Does not komandirskie cases. Old retention spring did not work. New one did not work. Ordered new ones from maker, that did not work. Groove for retention spring is not big enough to hold the spring.",1,199
This product is half sugar.,1,27
If these ever fit your kid I'd be surprised. They are VERY wide.,1,64
Arrived opened. Oil was everywhere. First application created awful stains on my boots and literally ruined my $300 pair of shoes. There are much better products out there to care for leather. Terrible product.,1,210
"First time I accidentally dropped it...it broke.  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy it.  Not a quality product",1,115
Color went clear and doesn't look anything like pictures. Fiancee is very upset,1,79
Very cheaply made. Disappointed.,1,32
They are way to short. Sizes are not right,1,42
"Very thin material, cheaply made, not great quality",1,51
The pant were too tight my grandson couldn't get them on at all. The tops were nice and fit well my grandson wanted the tops so i didn't send them back. Gave the pants to a smaller relative.,1,190
I was so excited to get this shirt but was extremely disappointed when I opened it. Not at all like the description. Shoulder cutouts are completely different than the picture. Feels super cheap.,1,195
The picture represents a stoned wash look.  The actually color is like a dark sky blue.  Does not look like denim at all.  Kept only because the fit is good.,1,157
I was excited to get my shirt but it is short and wide. They need to make it longer.,1,84
The small fits perfect in the legs but the waist is painfully tight. The medium fits in the waist but the legs are too loose.,1,125
This product is nothing like the picture. It was so thin and poorly made. It wouldn't keep my dog warm. It looked like it was warn and walked 100 times. So thin. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. It took almost a month to come.,1,230
"no snaps, buttons, zippers, etc. to make this a wearable item.  Would not recommend buying this jumpsuit at all",1,111
No me ha yegado,1,15
Nothing like the picture!,1,25
Very cheaply made. Broke the rubber strap away from the foot body on the first day out.,1,87
Haha...this definitely does not look like this picture.  Its judge and falls and looks like a hilarious giant lips ...definitely not what is shown,1,146
The stitching came apart not a quality job completed.,1,53
Too big. I ordered a M size and I got xxl size<br />I don’t recommend this product,1,82
"The logo is not at all as vibrant as the picture. The shirt is short, so I would not bother if you have a normal-long torso.",1,124
It’s way too short from the back. You can’t really wear a tank top:spaghetti strap shirt unless you still want all your back to be showing. Just not flattering at all.0,1,168
Make are cheap and to large,1,27
I bought the polka dot one and it didn't cinch my waist at all. I included a picture of a black corset from a different company for comparison and as you can see this polka dot one can barely even be called a corset. It's more like a large belt.,1,245
Lasted a little over 3 weeks with minimal wear,1,46
"I wear a large in shirts but this large fit like a small & the material is SUPER THIN, the last long sleeve turtle neck shirt I ordered from you all, not too long ago, wasn’t anything like the shirt I Received last time....highly dissatisfied & want a refund",1,258
It definitely doesn't have the shape that's pictured. If I size up to get the slouch effect it will just be too large. Kind of disappointing.,1,141
"Glasses that I received were not the same style as advertised, I was not happy with the purchase",1,96
It fell apart after the second time I wore it,1,45
Had to return it because I could't get the links out. Broke the tool that came with the watch trying.,1,101
"SEND ME THE RETURN LABEL ASAP. Absolutely the worse freaking dress I ever purchased on this site. Wrong description,  over a month and a half to receive, beyond frustrated.",1,172
No support folded right down,1,28
"The item i received is not the item in the picture. She has on a cotton zip up jumpsuit. They sent me some shiny material pants with strings! I was suppose to wear this, this sunday. Now i uave to hirry and find something to wear!!!",1,232
Huge. Slips right out.,1,22
No. Dress is two to three sizes larger than it should be. Shipping was fast yes but this dress is massive.,1,106
The wrong size was sent! I’m discussed trying to get a band for this watch which I do love!!!,1,93
Disappointed.  If you order this get a size larger than your regular size.,1,74
"Flimsy and cheap, way overpriced.",1,33
"Very pretty - but it broke before I had a chance to wear it. I put it on and a few minutes later it fell off - one of the pins holding the links together was either broken when it arrived, or, was never made properly.  Very sad.",1,228
"I wore mine today for the first time in 48 degree weather.  They are soft and pretty, but I could still feel the cold.  I would not trust them to keep my hands warm in colder temperatures.",1,188
Size up folks if runs small,1,27
These barely fit my 14 month old's fingers.  They are SO DARN TINY they are not for fingers as shown in the picture.,1,116
Runs super small,1,16
Band does not lock shut. Can't use it.,1,38
Awful! First of all I ordered a silver one twice but still got gold.,1,68
"I bought these underware for my husband before and I purchased the same thing, same size and it’s not the same size. It was like a size larger. I have washed them in hot water even.",1,181
"3 socks out of 5 were the correct size, the other two were tiny! Had to send back eventhough they are adorable..",1,112
Description is not accurate. These sunglasses are not polarized.,1,64
"This was a JOKE! I can't believe Amazon has this kind of items on their site. Was sent in a plastic bag to begin with, all wrinkled and the sleeves were extremely short and I'm 5'2&#34; so I'm  petite. And that's not a coat.It's a fleece jacket.",1,245
Ripped apart after one day,1,26
Size 32 is very small,1,21
"Not at all the material pictured. The picture lookalike textured material, it's not!  It's Tshirt material with a pattern inked on. Very long, 3 inches past by knees and I'm 5-5&#34;.  Going back",1,195
Shirt is ripped by the side 1 button is missing by arm. Is cheap fabric. Regret I bought this product. Not like showing in the picture! Not recommended to anybody,1,162
Was way smaller than expected,1,29
"Material cheap and see through. Didnt fit right, immediately returned. Not recommended to buy.",1,94
"The material in the picture is lighter and appears to be a heavier canvas material. The coat looks significantly thicker than what arrived. The jacket we got was made of a thin slick material, an olive green color, with a thin layer of fuzz inside.<br />We did not get the coat we ordered.",1,289
These are worthless.  These do not protect your eyes.,1,53
Shirt was xxx large not x large,1,31
"Although the website states that the sweater is  90% COTTON + 10% ACRYLIC, and the sweater has the same label on the inside, this is not cotton at all, it is fully acrylic. Item is being returned.",1,196
Disappointing. Beads were goldtone not silver. Threading was extremely thin. No polishing cloth...which is probably just fine because it's doubtful that the goldtone was dipped over 925 Sterling.,1,195
This coat is warm but the filling of the coat is coming through the entire coat. It is hard to explain but I give this coat a bad review. I had high expectations for it and if they could take care of that issue it would be a great coat.,1,236
These are way to big for a average size nose ring.,1,50
broken returned,1,15
This was too big for the watch it was supposed to fit. It looked weird and it was a gift. Very disappointed.,1,108
"The metal clasp was missing. I ordered this band when I ordered the watch to have as back up in the event the other band finally wore out, it did. I thought, no worries I have the back up band...no clasp piece, too late to request replacement. Lesson learned.",1,259
cheap crap made in either China or Mexico. shoddy material. a ripoff.,1,69
The material was very flimsy and the garment had no shape. The v cut was was to open on the cut and revealing. Just a cheap shirt. And no boob support.,1,151
Ordered for newborn pictures once our baby arrive. Even as a FTM I can tell this outfit is made for a 12 month old and I ordered the new born size.,1,147
cheap dollar store quality...,1,29
"After a month of wearing them, they started to fall apart! I've never had shoes break down that fast. See pictures.",1,115
"Piece of crap. Doesn't fit right, I don't know who they tested this on but my boobs look smushed, flat, popping out and ugly in this.",1,133
Runs very small and the fabric is super cheap and wrinkled and should be. Buttons just hang loose one fell off as soon as I put it on. Heck no.,1,143
"Very Very  Dissappointed , ordered months ago, never  heard anything ... I cancelled It. Never heard back ,  order came anyway!<br /> Very cheaply made , fabric looks like irregulars, fabric is faded in spots .... very thin , just terrible..",1,241
"I'm 5'4&#34; and 117 lbs - the jeans fit okay, but are not black - there is a white thread running through the material that looks horrible.  The quality is also horrible.  I'll be returning these.",1,197
Very poor quality. The nylon lining makes a crinkle sound when you touch it and the zippers are cheap and difficult to use. The long strap was missing. Returning asap.,1,167
Super cheaply made.,1,19
DEFINITELY NOT SILVER. Very disappointed the pictures all show the clear strapped sandals with silver studs but when received they are gold. That is literally the only reason I ordered them in the first place.,1,209
No quick release!  I was looking for the quick release that you can pull off using your thumb nail.  This item does not have that.  I will definitely be returning it.<br /><br />It looks fine other than that though.,1,215
Flimsy and I’ll fitting,1,23
This was not what I expected at all. I will wear it to sleep in because it’s more like a pajama top.,1,100
I had to send it back because the switch had a broken wire.,1,59
"However, I do have a riddle:<br />What has an awful branding, followed by a familiar but even worse take on that very branding?<br />This, I guess.<br />It may be a decent bag, but I don’t care to find out.",1,206
"I should have listened to the other reviewers. It's like a shiny, stretchy swimsuit material and looks odd and cheap as a dress. It does fit as expected but I returned it.",1,171
cheapo,1,6
"When I put these on my feet, I purred with pleasure; felt as walking on a cloud. Then the unexpected happened, they fell apart in less than a week - the stitching came away from the soul. I expected a better product from Dearfoams. Maybe a bad batch?",1,250
I was so excited for this. I love the design of this but the material was very thin and can see through w.o even bending over. Definitely not squat proof and would most likely return it. Kinda wrinkles on the 🐫 toe.,1,215
The package arrived open and the earrings weren't in the package at all.,1,72
"This was sent to me used, with someones hair on it. I washed it, disinfected it of course it didn't work. I received a 5$ credit, and the item went into the trash.",1,163
Very cheaply made. You can fit credit cards OR a phone NOT both! Very disappointed.,1,83
"Terrible fit horrible, latex smell he color wasnt a little off it was ""dark cognac"" but I got old lady tan..<br />Fit loose in all the wrong spots.",1,147
The material is nice but it is made very cheaply and it has a disproportionate cut.,1,83
Too gaudy.,1,10
the fit was awful. looks like a tablecloth. extremely unflattering.,1,67
"This mask was not as pictured, it seem the manufacture didn't let the ink dry before sending it out, so when I received it, the mask was a mess.",1,144
The velcro is poor quality,1,26
"Sent it back...  WAY to big for my head and it was impossible to see cuz of the floppiness of it all.  BUT it was good quality and very pretty, it just didn't work for me.",1,171
Way too big! Order 4 sizes down.,1,32
fit well minus the shortness of the shorts.,1,43
Product is about 3 sizes too small. Sizes are not accurate for American conversion,1,82

Both bracelets broke within a week. Totally not worth the money.  Super cheap and horribly made.,1,96

"It was beauitful, bur broke a week later",1,40

"This bra sucks if you're sweaty. I wore this with a dress for a wedding and I didn't even make it to the wedding and it was no longer sticky from sweating. Another note is I am a 34 DD, I got the D from reading other reviews and it did not quite cover the whole breast.",1,269
The bottom piece was loose when I received it and completely broke off within a day. Don't waste your money on an item you have to super glue together just to wear it.,1,167
"Four months after I bought the bag, the shoulder strap broke.",1,61
This dress was extremely thin and see<br />Through like a beach dress. I was extremely disappointed because the description was completely misleading.,1,150
"Looks good,appears to be  well made, but has ZERO support, even with a low impact dance class.",1,94
Cheap very cheap,1,16
Hated it... way too big for my head. Sound quality was lacking as well.,1,71
Not even close to the reader power.<br />A lense attached inside from a regular reader.<br />No Go.<br />Not a quality product.,1,127
Not even close. More like a medium.  No stretch at all.,1,55
It’s a robe. Not a dress.,1,25
"Kind of a cheap material, not a fan.",1,36
Sent wrong color combination...ugly color at top...ugg..Poor quality...Don't buy from them...,1,93
too many zippered pockets and confusing to remember where everything  went.,1,75
Not curly fluffy like listing pic. It's literally a bath robe without the loops and belt. Not something to wear out. Shape isn't flattering. Returning and ordering a bomber instead.,1,181
"The website description says that the shorts have 95% of cotton. However, I didn't find the label with the cotton percentage on it. It doesn't feel that there are even 50% of cotton in the shorts. Also the quality of the stiches is bad. I want to return the shorts.",1,265
Waist belt pockets was upside down but I did not have time to return it before our hiking trip.,1,95
"Wayyyy too big. So it was a completely useless purchase. Fell right off my large chickens even (brahmas)<br />The material is good, but what's the point if it's way too big",1,172
"Fabric is shiny and not at all like the picture. Runs large. Awkward length (I'm 5'7&#34; and I was almost to my ankles). If you're looking for a mumu, look no further.",1,168
SIZES ARE VERY BIG,1,18
Smells a little and I think it will get donated.,1,48
This shirt dress is short and very thin! Not a thick material as the picture appears.,1,85
This is not the colour I paid for The scrub is a light blue not a dark blue,1,75
The product is not true to size and the construction is not that great.,1,71
Does cancel out noise but it's uncomfortable and too tight,1,58
El tamaño bien pero la calidad muy mala yo jamás las use me llegaron abiertas,1,77
They were tarnished. So only the tunnels are stainless steel. Not very happy!,1,77
Ordered to fit size 0-6 Months and the shoes came in looking like they were big enough for a 3 year old. DISAPPOINTED!,1,118
Very sharp edges like cut your throat sharp..... poorly made,1,60
No good for big boobs. Materials no smooth!,1,43
The packaging was grime-covered and grime-filled inside and out. The tool itself was covered in scratches and unfinished metal extrusions. The slot does not fit even my smallest watch bracelet. Look elsewhere for this style of tool - this one got returned 5 minute after I opened it!,1,283
Anytime money exchanges hands receivers (you) have a constitutional right to sue all suppliers (Amazon web base companies as well as Amazon) for “faulty advertisement”.,1,168
exelente items,1,14
This product tips over easy and is not as sturdy as I had hoped it would be. Extension pole did not slide easily or lock and release as I would expect it to with the cost.,1,171
This stocking is made of very poor quality materials. The customized letters are simply inexpensive stickers that will easily come off. I contacted the seller and they were unable to offer any solution to the problem.,1,217
Does not stick long at all... I would put it in place and after five minutes it felt like it was peeling off again...,1,117
Muy mal producto,1,16
"NOT SURGICAL STEEL! Was really excited about these but as soon as I put them on I immediately started swelling up and got all itchy. If you have an jewelry allergy and are looking for surgical steel, these are not it!",1,217
The waistband is awful and comes up to my rib cage! Fabric is very sheer. Returned these immediately,1,100
"Loved the design but fit was way off.  Zipper stuck out, much too long in the torso, the arm holes were huge.  I'm 5'3, 95 lbs and the overall fit felt more like a large.",1,170
Crappy and cheap material. Probably fits a child perfectly. I was so excited for it. Wore it once and it gained a hole in it only after a less than 20 minute use.,1,162
This bag is very rough.  I thought it would soften but its cheaply made.  I used it twice and am not thrilled the strap twists and doesn't stay flat on your shoulder.  I wish i could return it but am past the very quick deadline.,1,229
The only thing I liked about this product is that it did in fact make my posture more upright but it’s squeeze the heck out of me and it was very uncomfortable to wear for more than half an hour.,1,195
If I can find it I like to send it back,1,39
Poorly made. Torn after several weeks of light usage,1,52
They are very flimsy. They are not strong enough to even go into your nose.,1,75
"Very disappointed, this sweater Does Not hang off one shoulder at all.",1,70
It doesn’t even resemble a bra It is made of poor quality material Don’t waste your money,1,89
These shorts are WAY TOO SMALL.The size chart was not accurate,1,62
The cut is too wide...a med more like xl..I'm 5'5 145...the design are like iron on stickers,1,92
"Sent it back, the decal was just an iron on and was all scrunched up. Not worth the money.",1,90
"This dress was too small across the chest, and when we submitted a return, we were instructed that we had to pay for return shipping back to CHINA!  This would cost more than the dress itself!  Buyer Beware!",1,207
"The stone came in pieces and the stone was out of the ring.It looks so nice , very disappointed.  What should I do ?",1,116
looked nicer online. makes me look a lot older than i really am.,1,64
"I’d return it if it wasn’t a pain. It’s too orange-ish to match anything & i’m NOT going to wear a slip, which is a must with this crappy see-through material.<br />Got a small & it fits right. I am 120-125 lb & 5’1. It hits just above my ankles.",1,246
"The lenses work great - bought them for fishing and you can really see into the water. However, they are already delaminating. The a 1/8&#34; strip along the bottom of each lens has the film peeling off the inside. Very disappointing.",1,234
"These pants were a huge disappointment.  Not only were they way too small (Chinese sizing?  Don't really know), but they were also very poor quality.  I'm returning the ones I purchased.",1,186
"Doesnt sit right, see through and runs big",1,42
"Was too big & I didn’t like the material. What isn’t good for me, may be great for someone else.",1,96
"Too much to do, a shaper should be easy on easy off",1,51
"Got it for my daughter for Christmas, fully charged worked for an hour now it won’t work won’t charge, it’s done",1,112
The lense fell out in about 4 days and could not be placed back in without bending the frame.,1,93
"Super small, no stretch, not cute at all. Returned.",1,51
One of the bracelets broke the first few days.,1,46
The “neck hole” is weirdly small.  Not sure how they expect a person to put the bathing suit on.,1,96
They started turning,1,20
"This is junk, metal came tarnished while still in the package and the clasps would not open due to the tarnished material.",1,122
"Ugly! and extremely big and bulky. Also, the opening of this bag is very narrow and zipper quality is not the best.",1,115
They were broke on side where arm connects to the shades. Metal frame had a small kink/bend in them that probably contributed to the arm being broken.,1,150
"Están bonitos,pero no los voy a usar por que están rotos,",1,57
Not very good quality at all and hate the fit,1,45
Quality hat but Winchester is like sticker,1,42
It was not even worn for a day before the chain broke. The pendant keeps opening. Very pretty but not a good buy.,1,113
I should have listened to the reviews...the clasp is horrible and will not stay closed. Back to Amazon.<br /><br />If there was a way I could leave zero stars I would.,1,167
Don't like this suit,1,20
"I cant get it off, one side is stuck in.",1,40
it was ok for the money,1,23
"Trash, fell apart within 5 mins if putting it on",1,48
Order a large and it will not even fit a teenage.,1,49
"Within 2 days the extremely poorly crafted band began losing its texture, stretching at the holes and sides. The paint on the metal pieces almost instantly started chipping and the pin is so small and flimsy that a quick turn of the wrist all but guarantees that your watch will fly off.",1,287
The ring looks nothing like the picture.,1,40
Terrible. Turned my finger green in a day. Ended up throwing it in a snow bank,1,78
Material was way too thin,1,25
"The band was suppose to fit Charge 4 - no end pieces to attach , so useless - not worth the hassle to return, but will NOT buy from t hem again!",1,144
"Crap, gloves arrived with a tear in the seam of the palm. They are cheap (not inexpensive but cheap) and In no way will last the winter.",1,136
Looked dirty and old. Like they’d give you tetanus or something haha,1,68
The adjustable strap is too short. I do not have a big waistline. I extended the belt all the way out and it was still too short and the strap is cheap quality.,1,160
I wear a large so to be on the safe size I order one size up thinking that would help. But to my surprise even with one size up it still didn't fit.,1,148
Unfortunately this was too short and shrunk when washed.,1,56
"The dress is not the big problem, this dress was cute but a little big for me so I returned but I didn’t received my refund yet",1,127
I’ve had my belly button piercing for 11 years now and have never had an infection until using one of these belly rings.,1,120
"came with a rock missing, and plated gold looked tarnished.",1,59
Wasent impress,1,14
"The first time I ordered it, shirt was dropped off at some random locker and so I never received it.. I ordered another shirt and ended up returning it item because it was way too big and not what I expected.  Definitely didn't look like picture. I ordered a different one and was happy with it.",1,295
Very disappointed i was sent a used-returned pair with the tag cut from the inseam as well as the retail tags cut of the shorts.<br />overall quality seems to be cheaply made and i assume the shorts will not hold up well.<br />I will be returning,1,246
The fit was off and it had a funky smell.,1,41
I requested return. They said they don't accept return. Dont waste your money. Quality is so bad. People will laugh if you wear it.,1,131
Very cheap material. Dose not look like photo. The f racism dose not show when wearing.,1,87
Broke in first use :(,1,21
Terrible quality. Loose strings hanging from the seems.,1,55

They did absoultely nothing.  Felt Like i was looking through glass. nothing....,1,80
These hurt my kid's ankles. They can't even wear them.,1,54
"Cute watch, but it didn't keep time.  I don't know if it was a bad battery or just the watch.  I sent it back.  Piece of junk.",1,126
"poorly made, the heel came off after wearing them just once. my daughter cried the entire night because her feet were hurting. the shoe offers zero support, just a costume type shoe that can really only be worn once.",1,216
"this is not the type of dino mask you use to make a fursuit, this is flimsy plastic",1,83

It  did not match,1,17
Does not look anything like the material shown in the picture.,1,62
Ordered purple. Got brown and yellow. Cheap fabric.,1,51

It began to change color after wearing it a couple times its a copper color on the back :(,1,90
"The top was cute, but the skirt is straight grandma vibes. Not cute at all. Looks like a table cloth.",1,101
"Huge, and baggy to boot.  Ordered XL, my usual size, and these fit like XXXXL.",1,78
Not comfortable at all....,1,26
"These are very thin and poorly sewn shorts and run extremely small. Frankly these are not even worth $2.00. I am returning them. I bought these for a person who is 4'7"" and 87 lbs and could not get the shorts to pull up past her lower thighs. I have seen better shorts at a swap meet.",1,284
"Disappointed, I bought this for traveling received in enough time but missing straps for bag. One zipper does not work correctly. Now have to go buy another bag to travel with.",1,176
The back pocket tore off at the rivet the first day I wore these. I couldn't even sew it back together as the hole was too noticeable. Very disappointed. Wasted my money.,1,170
Felt and looked like pajama material! They pictured it with the model wearing heels and holding a nice clutch but the dress just isn't fit for that... Had to return.,1,165
Disappointed of my purchase.,1,28
It’s ok. Not the best,1,21
"This is super baggy and is not form fitting at all. Also, very see through. The fit from the picture is misleading.",1,115
Bought this for an upcoming trip and after a few hours in the pool the part where you hook in the snap tore off. Very disappointing. Luckily had pack an additional bathing suit that I got from Walmart about a year ago which has withstood an entire summer already and this trip as well.,1,285
"Took it out of the box, went to put it on for the first time, and the metal clasp instantly came off. If you’ve seen the movie “Jingle All the Way”, it was like the scene where Howard opens the Turboman from the Santa Black Market and it completely falls apart.",1,261
Ring was very low detailed and looked different.,1,48
"Not what I expected, will be using it for a nightgown. I cannot wear this in the streets.",1,89
Not what I expected not a compresión shirt at all,1,49
They were very nice just extremely over sized.,1,46
👎👎👎👎👎👎,1,6
"Much thinner than I expected based on the description. Flimsy, lacking “bulk and insulation “ I typically purchase in other brands.",1,131
Didn't like at all looks very cheap! Sending it back,1,52
Item to small. It isn’t true to size.,1,37
"I thought this loop was going to fit, but it doesn't. I filled out the return form with a question about returning this item and received no response!",1,150
"Returning, too small. Another brand I ordered same size as these was the right for.?",1,84
Confort,1,7
Saw other reviews that suggested ordering a larger size than you normally wear.  The largest size available was an XXXXL (14).  So that's what I ordered.  Way too small.  Obviously these blouses are not made with American women in mind.,1,236
"Backs of earring a are cheap plastic, I can't go a whole day of wearing a pair without loosening one, or both. I only have 3 earring left from this set none of them the same pair",1,178
Too big never wore it. No support.,1,34
Broke them trying to straighten the right temple/arm before realizing the hinge itself was crooked. Never worn,1,110
These fit when new but not after one wash.,1,42
The size was entirely off despite sending my measurements. I couldn’t even get it over my thighs. It was super stiff but the inside was moist as If the package had been wet. There were black spots all over the dress.,1,216
"Battery lasted less than a month. Materials are also that off the lowest quality, but that’s expected at this price, but the battery lasting less than a month is inexcusable.",1,174
Waste of money.<br />Just go to a piercing place if you want something of quality.<br />This broke in literally two days and is not hypoallergenic.,1,147
"Doesn't look like the photo, it's all over the place, I took a bigger size than what I normally wear and it didn't fit. Not pleased so I'm returning it.",1,152
"They might work for a hamster, but too small for a human",1,56
Thought I bought a cute 4th of July outfit or my daughter. Finally received it only to see it says “Democrat” all over the top. Could have done without politics being brought into kids clothing!,1,194
Cheap looking. The ropes are not seperated and you can see the metal underneath. Cheap looking.,1,95
This dress is COMPLETELY SHEER. I was wearing black underwear and it was clear as day. I would never wear this out in public. It's more like bedroom lingerie if you like that kind of thing. I requested a refund and got denied unless I would send a photo.,1,254
It says one size but I'm a size 8-10 and these were way to small for me.,1,72
"Fabric has no streatch, especially for big butt huys like me.",1,61
"I really liked the mask and it's quality, my 1 star review is because the box came open and not sure if anyone tried the product before, and considering it's a face mask, I shouldn't have this doubt.",1,199
It got rusty after wearing it for the first time wow,1,52
Like and never used it yet,1,26
"This the exact type of cami I love. But these are NOT made well. One of them had a strap rip right out of package, the second one didn't even make it through 2 washes. Very bummed.",1,180
"I thought these shoes looked really cute online, but they are very uncomfortable! I thought the ankle strap would make them better than other shoes that have a tendency to slip off, which it does, but your foot feels like it's at such a weird angle. I would not buy these shoes.",1,278
The fit was good but tore up in the wash I would not buy  I guess you get what you pay for,1,90
Cute shoes but way too small. I got size 4 but it's more of size 2. It's a waste of money!,1,90
The fabric. Very cheap.,1,23
You can see right through the dress. Very cheap and not flattering. I am returning.,1,83
"Not worth the money to me. Advertised as very dark, but they are very light.",1,76
"""Dress"" does not look at all like what is pictured. Different pattern, different length even. Extremely disappointed.",1,117
Filter section does not cover nose.. Mask covers nicely however if you breathe through your nose no carbon filter protection.. Poorly designed..<br />Waste of money..,1,166
0 stars to this product .My pants came in torn and I’m not able to use them .I  do not  recommend this  page at all,1,115

"Disgusted. I ordered a 2x based on the size chart. I'm a size 14 and this item is for a size 8. Made in China, cheap, and poor quality.",1,135
These bands are 2 separate pieces. They are not hoops. Very difficult to get on.<br />Don't bother.,1,99
Again must buy two to three size larger.,1,40
Its definitely super cheap material. VERY see through and its definitely not the same color as pictured<br />The top wasnt but bat the zipper part had a piece of little metal sticking out. All around it sucked,1,209
will not stay on :( like the idea needs to be heavier i think,1,61
"the amount of feathers flying around my house was offensive. this thing is just a graduation gown with cheap feathers from a child's boa glued on. When I asked to return it, the seller didn't even want it back. You know that is a great sign about how they feel about their product.",1,281
The pants are Definitely not a Large. the fabric was nice and i know if they did fit me they would be super cute but they are way too small.,1,140
Tip too big and overalls too small.,1,35
I gave this watch to my husband who is an electrical engineer. He found the instructions nigh impossible to understand and of use in setting it up for use. I cannot recommend this watch. It is pretty but not practical in any manner.,1,232
Studied the sizing guide. Read the reviews. Ordered accordingly. Couldn’t even get it over my head. Garage sale next Fall.,1,122
Honestly have no idea on the fit as I knew it was being returned as soon as I removed it from the package.,1,106
"TOO SMALL, IT LOOKS BIGGER IN PICTURES",1,38

Material was too heavy and weighted the dress down. Photos it looked flattering but not on in person.,1,101
Put up mid May. August 3rd and the color went from burgundy to pink due to the sun. Not thrilled by the color fade so fast. I didn’t plan on a new umbrella every year.,1,167
Runs very small! 2x fit like a medium! Definitely will be returning.,1,68
"I loved this dress at first! It fit perfectly, but after I washed it one time, it shrunk to a super small size.  So...it's great for a one-time wear!",1,149
"Loved the socks, the comfort, the fit.  Everything... except they only lasted a few months before holes began to appear.  No durability at all.",1,143
Small cut thus your true size you will need to go up one,1,56
"Small, clingy and gross. At least it was easy to return.",1,56
"This is a top and bottom set. I only received the top, which is just as advertised, but no bottom. I sent a note to Seller, got no reply. I am trying to reach Amazon.",1,166
Well i went for a swim in the river and the watch came undone I’m assuming from the pin that locks onto the watch since it had happened to me before while driving.  So unless this company gives you money for a new watch. Get something maybe name brand?,1,252
It fits awkwardly. The bust isn't in any proportion,1,51
Measurements are off. Way smaller than what it says...,1,54
Can't sew anything at all.,1,26
Looked and fitted nothing like the image. You should look elsewhere.,1,68
The shirt feels weird and silky almost? Not much stretch or give and not super comfortable to be honest.,1,104
I bought the light pink and it looks like pajamas. The material is really thin and doesn’t look like “clothes” at all. Very disappointed.,1,137
2.5 weeks of wear and the sole is already coming off.  Such a waste of money,1,76
Looks NOTHING like the image shown. Not at all what I was expecting. The material is shiny polyester and fits awful. Returned.,1,126

Zipper broke first use,1,22

Zipper broke after a few times worn,1,35
Never arraived...china made,1,27
Awful fabric so cheap and very sweaty,1,37
"The fabric is very cheap and itchy. Do not recommend st all. For the price I paid, I expected something at least a little softer. Side seams arrived unstitched.",1,160

[[VIDEOID:6ddc91fd9725fd662bce40b42a82c6e6]] The way they fit and feel on my feet. They feel like you're wearing boxes on your feet.,1,132
Don’t buy this shirt. I ordered a medium which usually I am a small and can’t even get it over my shoulders and the arms are for a teenager.,1,140
There isn't a single rhinestone on these &#34;rhinestone glasses.&#34;  Instead it's carved out divots painted silver.  Save your money.,1,136
This is very cheap material and and very small and does not stay open when expanded,1,83

"It's horrible! Once I got it on, I couldn't get it of! Kind of scary!!",1,70

Terrible terrible TERRIBLE quality. Nothing like the picture. The Bruins are uneven and crooked. Paper thin. What I got is NOT what is pictured.,1,144
My pair arrived with runs in the polarization on the right lens. Really messes with vision. Cannot wear like this. Not satisfied at all.,1,136

"Xxl was more like a large, and the fabric is too warm for summer golf in Az.",1,76
Item arrived broken,1,19
Way smaller than what's pictured. The picture with the earring in the ear can't possibly be the same as the one received. The only reason I won't send back is because my daughter would like to use it for the second hole in her ear.,1,231
They broke the arm hinge came unglued from the frame within 2 months,1,68
does not fit earring posts,1,26
I do not like how u can't screw on tightly due to if you do then butterflies aren't facing same way. Very pretty but not happy,1,126
"Broke the second time I used it. Literally broke itself upon opening it. I get that it's cheap, but that doesn't justify it breaking that easily. Buy something else.",1,165
"Came in late, size was too large, and you can see through the pants even before putting it on.  It did not fit or look as we would expect it to.  I have to wear black stockings or leggings under it to hide the fact you can see right through it",1,243
These bras fell apart after the first washing wires came out not happy with this product,1,88

This is false advertising. The sweater is not a sweater at all but very thin material.,1,86
Terrible. The lens was scratched. The arms were hard to open and close. Don't waste your money on these like I did.,1,115
I received only 12 masks and no stickers when the listing said 24 masks and stickers. So couldn’t use these for son’s birthday party. Really disappointed!,1,154
These are for little little children.,1,37
"The material is very cheap... I know they don't cost much, but literally from just one use my back side of neck behind ear got green. ONE USE !",1,143
runs REALLY small,1,17
"Terrible, used all 8 for just my bottom grill. Terrible quality and I wouldn’t trust them to hold the top even if I had some leftover. Doesn’t get soft unless you boil the water unlike most other molds",1,201
Does not look at all what is pictured.,1,38
Such a disappointment!  The fabric is kind of stiff and doesn't hold its shape after one wash.  It's not flow-y like the picture suggests.  It's also sewn asymmetrically so the racerback is not centered and the tank will twist while you are wearing it.,1,252
Haven’t even worn for a week and the stone fell out!  Very disappointed,1,71
The same thing happened to the first pair of this one as the other one and the heels wore out.,1,94
Half of the rings I couldn't unscrew even with pliers.,1,54
"Very pretty pieces, except the longer moon chain came broken in 5 pieces and the choker was also missing a connection. Extremely poor quality.",1,142
Terrible cheap quality not as warm as it looks. If you are usually a medium I highly recommend a large instead or just don’t even buy it. I honestly wish I was of saved the money. I may try to return it,1,202
"Very light weight, feels cheap",1,30
Sizing was inaccurate,1,21
Was too small for the watch. Said 42mm and was off by 2/3 mm. The pins were cheap.,1,82
"Looks very cheap , thin fabric, way too small.",1,46
Runs VERY large!! I am 5'6&#34; 125lbs and this was like a dress on me. Needed it for work and now I have to keep looking,1,121
"The black coating on the sunglasses started peeling after one day of wearing these in Mexico on vacation - really cheap, poor quality!",1,134
It was a waste of money. I thought it was wearable..,1,52
Look cheap in real time,1,23
"This hat does not fit my infant. It is five sizes too big, I feel it would fit my baby when they are one or two years old.",1,122
Broke 2 weeks after purchasing.,1,31
If you touch the pom it sheds upon touch,1,40
This will not fit a regular adult males wrist. It is way too tight. You have to have a very tiny wrist for this to fit you properly and comfortably. The bracelet is made well but there is no give in it which is a little annoying. Was really looking forward to wearing this and buying others,1,290
It was to big and I totally did not like the style when it was delivered. It was not what I expected at all. I would not recommend it or reorder this style at all. Totally disappointed,1,184
These gloves absolutely reek of dead fish. Wash your hands with soap and it doesnt go away. Not the least bit warm either.,1,122
Fell apart after 1 week. Screws fell out. Returned.,1,51
Cheap spandex material. If your looking for elegant gloves these are not the ones. These are more like super hero style gloves.,1,127
"Very cheap quality, too thin, and see through. Was very disappointed.",1,69
"Horrible, does not do a dang thing. Might as well not wear a bra",1,64
Fell apart first time wearing,1,29
"One of the chains was broken before I even opened the package. And another chain broke while I was trying to fix it. Total garbage. Also... it is a weird cheesy gold color, not the nice gold that is in the picture. Don't waste your money.",1,238
The material was cheap.  Going to return.,1,41
This jewelry set looked nice in the picture but in reality looks very cheap with poor finishing touches so I had to return it.,1,126
Not as cute as it looks. The weave look is actually just a print. It reminds me of scrubs that medical personnel would wear.,1,124
Flimsy and not the same from the picture DO NOT BUY  it’s a scam,1,64
Pretty but not durable at all. Charm fell off before I could even try it on. Had to return it. Disappointed.,1,108
Broke 3 days in,1,15
"They were great for a couple months, then the fabric separated from the seam and ripped. I've had better luck with shapers from JC Penney! And half the cost.",1,157
"The dimensions provided in the sizing chart are nowhere near accurate. For instance, the actual sleeve length on the medium is 24.25 inches.",1,140
If you are hoping to use these as nipple rings like advertised save your money.,1,79
This is a basic womenswear’s  with an opening in the front !! No support no pouch no a good feeling for a man’s  genitals ….,1,124
they seem overpriced for what i received.,1,41
It was very tight around the arms I wish I could've been more stretchy around the Arms,1,86
Runs small. Not the best quality. Disappointed.,1,47
They're for a child. Gave to my 9 year old niece & she said I'm not a baby. Bamboozled,1,86
"Just got these in the mail today. They are soo cute, unfortunately, I went to try them on and both earrings immediately fell apart in my hands. extremely disappointing!! Never even got them in my ears.",1,201
Junk. Fit is feeble. Quality seems cheap. I returned.,1,53
Major issue w/the silk screening process. Where is Disney's quality control? Buyer beware.. Also way too big & it was late. Now I have an errand to return this shirt. Too nervous to order again.,1,194
"Not happy with product, it is not what u see on line in color and thickness. The man's ring is to thin",1,102
The box was severely damaged. I had to take the gloves out what was left of the box,1,83
Difficult as hell to open and they all broke. What a waste.,1,59
"Much much smaller than what was seen in the photo on the website.  Had difficulty putting them on - they were thin and did not stay in place. Anyway, they  fell off a couple of hours later. But not a big loss. Would not recommend buying them. If I could give no stars, I would.",1,277
Extremely cheap- much worse quality than I was expecting,1,56
Cheap looking plastic...for the price I paid and shipping,1,57
THE WORST QUALITY EVER!! It feels and looks like cheap Halloween costume material !,1,83
"Fits well, but rose gold color is very short lasting. Would not recommend purchasing this band.",1,95
"After 2 weeks, the rocks fall off",1,33
This is not soft. It's just regular. And the seam split on the thigh the first day it was worn.,1,95
"I ordered 2X, they sent 4X CHINA SIZE & it was TOO SMALL!!!  Disappointed!!!  Never again will I buy clothes online from China.",1,127
I got this bracelet for my 14 year old son. It broke when he put it on for the first time.,1,90
If you have large breasts then just forget about this dress. I returned it.,1,75
Runs very small. Looked somewhat different than the picture,1,59
These pearl earrings have been such a disappointment.  They broke within two months and found out the posts were HOLLOW. Not solid posts which eventually bent.  Very cheap posts for 14k gold and pearl fell off of one post.,1,222
Terribly made...the first pair ripped in multiple spots as I put them on and a second pair ripped while wearing! They were the correct size and everything. Very disappointed.,1,174
Returned these and went back to my camo web belt with the metal buckle. Plastic buckles just aren't as strong and can't stay closed even when I'm not wearing them.,1,163
Too small,1,9
Not worth it. Not legit merch.,1,30
Very wide crop top. Weird fit. Cheap material.,1,46
"Cheap writing , looks like iron-on.",1,35
Cheap looking . Looks like a pijama and the white part is completely see through .,1,82
"If I could rate these zero stars I would.  Broke after the second use.  Cheap crap, do not buy!!",1,96
Lace came off he first time my grand daughter put it on. Great color and design,1,79
I bought the red dress in a medium. I did not even try it on because it was red LACE over polyester and very cheaply made. No smooth fabric or retro design as in the picture. Wouldn't pay $2.00 at a yard sale for it. Returned.,1,226
The scarf in the picture IS NOT what I got. This is some cheap polyester knock off from China.,1,94
Fit is terrible! All my bathing suits are small. I ordered a medium as an influencer suggested this suit and she wore a medium. It was way way to small. Too small around hips (27in) and no way I could walk out in public wearing the top. And I like skimpier suits...,1,265
Bought two pairs and both broke after two days in same place,1,60
Don’t work,1,10
I sized up to a large (I'm normally between a medium and a large) and they were still tiny. Would not recommend.,1,112
It’s very cheaply made. It doesn’t look the photo at all. Mostly clear with purple glitter here and there. I would return if I didn’t have to pay postage to China.,1,163
Terrible! It fell apart in the arms the first time i wore it,1,60
"Very cheap material. the white is more of a dirty white than new and clean looking. Never going to wear it. does not fit like a bathing suite, not even bathing suite material.",1,175
"no, not for me",1,14
"It was cheap made , didn’t hold but only once , I would not recommend..",1,71
Cheap don’t waste your money,1,28
"The print on the ""dress"" looks exactly as shown in the picture. There is NO way I could wear this as a dress as it would not cover but half of my butt cheeks. I ordered the size I normally wear, which is large,  and it fits like a small. It only gets a one star b/c I have to give it a star.",1,291
These were SO tight. I couldn't believe it. Sizing completely off. I wound up returning.,1,88
The yellow is gold not yellow. Save your money,1,46
"My son bought this for my birthday present. It looked fairly nice, cheap looking but ok. After only two days off wearing the necklace it broke in two. I would not recommend this to anyone! Even if it is cheap. You will be wasting your money!",1,241
"These are very cute earrings don't get me wrong but they aren't stainless steel. If you don't have sensitive ears I would recommend  them but after the burning, itching and peeling skin mine will be going directly in the trash.",1,227
"Too small, and unable to return. I'm not happy. Can't even exchange for a larger size, etc.",1,91
"Super small! Inaccurate size chart, inflexible material for movement and thin. BUYER BEWARE!!! They claim free returns but you have to pay for shipping",1,151
My item was not in box,1,22
The dress came with a weird bleach-like stain on the shoulder. I had super high hopes and was very excited. Will not be buying this brand again,1,143
"SNAD-The tag indicates this is 95% rayon and 5% spandex, not cotton as the description repeatedly states! I will be returning this!",1,131
The material is flimsy and has a waffled texture. Size and fit is completely off. Returned.,1,91
This watch is clown big. Considering putting it on the wall it is so big.,1,73
Fits way small. Discontinued wearing. Good quality and fabric is comfortable,1,76
These run big. And wasn’t what I was looking for.,1,49
"Size medium fit my 7 year old. Uhh, don't waste your money. Bottom white half completely see through.",1,101
They dont stay on the ear as shown.  They ffall down,1,52
"The belt feels like rubber. It's limp, unlike any belt I've ever owned. It does not give any real support for the pants without ratcheting it real tight.",1,153
not long enough but too big in the chest - ugly,1,47
"came in broken and had a cheap look and feel to it, returned the next day.",1,74
This item lost the yellow gold coloring almost immediately. It turned an ugly brassy color. Do not recommend! I threw mine away. Waste of money!!!,1,146
It was my size everywhere except it’s too short.  Couldn’t wear it.,1,67
Shirt is to small,1,17
Totally disappointed. Stones came out like they were never set.,1,63
Battery dead!<br />Thanks,1,25
Unable to get picture in both sides. One side of the locket is fused shut. The picture got ruined and I cut myself trying to pry it open.<br />The locket now won’t close,1,169
Just no!,1,8
I counted 47 charms but not one is a virgo . iam highly upset and displeased with the product for one im a virgo yall couldve atleast have 1 virgo charm in the pack even though i was supposed to get 4 of each meaning 4 virgo charms.,1,232
Came bent out of shape & broke when I tried to fix it,1,53
If I could give this negative stars I would!!! Horrible. The dress had holes in it and the tool is way too long!,1,112
Quality not very excellent,1,26
"The item ran small, the fabric did not hang well and was uncomfortable.",1,71
The hat looked like it had been balled up and put in a small bag. Horrible way to ship a hat.,1,93
Would have fit a 10 yr old fine.,1,32
It broke after first time wearing it.  Very cheap!,1,50
"It was so small, I immediately returned it and bought something else",1,68
Way smaller and shorter than expected.,1,38
Not exactly what was described,1,30
This was definitely not what was expected. Delivery took a long time and discovered this was coming from China. The fabric was cheap and thin. Tried to return and it was going to cost more in shipping. Not a huge loss but would not recommend buying. There are better products out there.,1,286
"Material is completely see through, no way you could wear it as a outfit unless you wore clothes underneath it. So bummed.",1,122
I never got my mask. It's been 2 months. also says I can't get a refund.,1,72
Modelo diferente...super pequeño ademas!,1,40
The first time I wore this bracelet ALL the charms fell off!,1,60
Le ponen exageradamente perfume tienes que lavar muy bien y aparte de ve tan viejita como si ya la unieran utilizado,1,116
Does not fit well on ear. Wouldn't  recommend.,1,46
The lettering is smudged at the bottom. Very disappointed that this would be shipped out to a paying customer. This is something you expect to find at a discount store. Over all the shirt is cute I just wish it didn’t look like we tried to make it in our basement.,1,264
The logo on the front of the hat is far off center and very noticeable. I was excited about wearing this hat but it is so far off kilter that I'll never wear it in public.,1,171
Not flattering and cheap fabric.  Doesn’t have a waste and it’s cropped .,1,73
I am very disappointed with this product not only it doesn't show the same as the picture but I found a maxi pad inside one of the zippered compartment of the handbag switch it tell me that this handbag is used..,1,212
I paid for expedited shipping so they arrived very fast but they are made of some thin spandex material save your money go to Walmart and buy some fabric to make your own because these won't stop anything!,1,205
"Received this purse and was pleased with color, size and style.  However, after 2 days of carrying it, one of the straps came unsewn!!  So having to return it.",1,159
Way to small for me,1,19
I bought two of these shirts same size 4. One fit right but the this one was too small. They do look cheap. Poorly made.,1,120
Pendant fell.off,1,16
"Faded after 3 days and leaving green crap on the finger , very displeased.",1,74
"If I could give it 0 stars I would. It is the tiniest bracelet in the world. My cousin weighs 110 pounds, has the smallest wrists I have ever seen and this was too small for her. This would maybe fit a toddler.",1,210
This dress is cute but feels like I’m wearing a tent. You’d certainly not want to wear this on a windy day.,1,107
"I can't even give one star but to leave a comment I do not have a choice. The purse did not last two weeks of use! One strap came off, the brackets are pulling away with edges that are so sharp that when I attempted to fix the bracket it cut my finger. So not happy!",1,266
Is cheap! the lenses crackled like cellophane  The frames looked like pressed tin.  I would have expected to buy these sunglasses in bulk for a nickel a piece. Something you'd see in a little girl's party bag. I genuinely would not have paid a dollar for these.,1,261
"WAY TOO SMALL! Even in the largest size, this is barely a US Large.",1,67
Worng colors i didn't order these colors bad,1,44
POOR QUALITY - I'd say you get what you pay for - but this isn't worth a dime.,1,78
The bag I received didn't look like the one in the picture. I was disappointed.,1,79
This was bought for my sisters wedding set and the rings turned her finger green. The silver faded off and now just looks like a cheap ring. Very dissatisfied with this product!,1,177
"If I could give this zero stars I would.  These do absolutely nothing for glare at night,  they just make things darker.  It actually may be dangerous to wear these at night.  Extremely uncomfortable as well.",1,208
It looks nice but the size is too small,1,39
The threading was off and it ruined the entire navel ring!!!,1,60
"Half of these earrings have the screws on the wrong side, which means that if I want to wear them, I have to put them in from the back of my ear. I tried switching them around, but even with pliers, it's not happening.",1,218
"Very pretty earrings, but arrived broken. They appeared to have been returned and were sent out again. No quality control. Expected better for the price point.",1,159
Very very cheap material. literaly felt material stuck together. can make yourself. don't buy,1,93
Fitting is off,1,14
Worn this belt three times and the color has already begun to peel off the belt.  Very disappointed.,1,100
Horrible fabric.  Not the best quality and it was way too big,1,61
It was too small and they wouldn’t pay to return it. That was supposed to be one of the perks of using AMAZON.,1,110
"The maker needs to get sizes right.  This top is about 3 sizes too big, and the material used is too stretchy, causing it to hang and stretch.",1,142
Sadly when receiving this product one of the stones were already missing. This is a gift for a family member and I’m disappointed. I can’t gift this knowing it’s missing a stone.,1,178
Not happy with this item. Stitching is poorly done.. its horribly made...,1,73
LOVE THEM!,1,10
cheap. it faded quickly and my daughter got very little use from it.,1,68
"I don't like the bottom of the dress, not the same as the picture",1,65
Not happy with this product at all some stones were missing and loose in bag and the jewelry it’s tarnished lookig,1,114
"Watch worked only for a few hours on day 1, then it simply stopped working.",1,75
Did not like it. TOO BIG!,1,25
"Horrible design. Looks like a bag of trash on the head. The inside is nice, they should have use the same cut in the outside.",1,125
"The blouse was ugly,looks nothing like the picture 😒",1,52
It cost more for shipping and returning then it was worth. Never again. Badly sewn,1,82
Was a gift wasn’t made correctly seams are all messed up,1,56
Might be great if you're tall and thin.,1,39
"This fits loose at the top, ok at the waist, but oh boy , you better wear something underneath.  I can NOT bend even the slightest without my hiney coming out.",1,159
Was supposed to be a large 12/14 and was similar to a small 6/7. Purchased for my son.,1,86
Stone fell off the first day,1,28
Fabric is not good. Very cheap looking and feeling.,1,51
I wore it one day and it develop a hole in the seam. I order 3 of these in different colors. I don't think I will order anymore as they are poorly made. They are very thin and don't have much support and compression.,1,216
"This suit looked way better in the photo. It's got a small waistband, but a really large blouse top. Kinda looked like a grandma suit and the color was more blue than the picture looked.",1,186
I purchased this but will be returning based on its size,1,56
Nothing like the pic return right away,1,38
These are definitely not sized correctly. I purchased a 3xl and what i got looked and fit like an XL. Save your money.,1,118
"I ordered a size eight, which I normally wear and the bottom was too loose.  I returned it.",1,91
cheap looking earrings.  Reminds me of kids play jewellery. CZ feels and looks like the plastic glued on beads.  I won’t wear them out.  Feel cheated.,1,150
horrible color.  never saw a color like this.,1,45
"Totally useless, not even worth asking for a refund.  I have thought of alternative that would be far superior, but I have to get the right part to make it work.",1,161
Zero support if you have any breasts. Poorly made.,1,50
Highly highly allergic to pendant and chain. itchy and red with in minutes of putting it on. left marks for two days after putting on for 10 minutes. Not stated anywhere what it is made of. Very cheap. Most likely nickel.,1,221
"Gotta be knock offs, in my opinion. Paper thin material, won't fit a teenager.<br />Made off shore for sure<br /><br />Aboud is known for Quality. This is not....<br />In my opinion",1,181
It fits more or less ok. Was too short then I thought. It doesn't look like the picture at all. Will not buy from kearia anymore.,1,129
Runs really small.  I love leopard print clothes and shoes!,1,59
Makes you look larger than you are,1,34
Arrived broken and I returned it.  Cheaply made and not worth the price.  I ended up going with a full sized umbrella and a stand.,1,130
They broke :(,1,13
"I returned these. The sizing was off, the length was too short, the  denim doesn't stretch and I felt they were just all around cheaply made.",1,141
Did not like it looks like a blanket more would. Not wear it to go out,1,70
Clearly stated on the site that it had a lobster clasp and instead had a spring ring type of clasp.,1,99
"No es el color que aparece en la foto<br />Y como soy una compradora de sudamerica, Asuncion Paraguay..., no puedo cambiar",1,122
The latch on the pin would not stay closed. Very disappointed!,1,62
It's not anywhere near ad<br />Size a joke. Made  a<br /> 32 A ad says it's 44.,1,79
The small was huge. Do not recommend.,1,37
"These are regular plain old sunglasses total rip off,,, nice case tho",1,69
Does not look as expected. It looks like someone threw up on your feet. I'm sorry but I wish I spent my money elsewhere...,1,122
Absolutely awful! The material is hot and plastic like!,1,55
THE PRODUCT CAME: ONE SHOW DIFFERENT VS THE OTHER. BOTH DIFFERENT STYLE AND SIZE.,1,81
Liked but two small,1,19
DO NOT BUY IT!!! IT IS NOT 100% Neoprene / 100% Cotton.<br /><br />No lo compren!!! No es 100% Neoprene / 100% Cotton como dicen.  Fue un error comprar esto que no sirve.,1,170
Item arrived broken very poor quality as well.,1,46
Just arrived yesterday evening after one of wear the red durag cap is finished. My son wore the black cap that is also starting to separate. What a waste,1,153
Weird fit and scratchy material,1,31
Order your size. The chart told me I needed to go up a size n the crap was to big,1,81
"Very small  it said 7 inches  was 6 inches,And was late in delivery. Returned it..",1,82
Every single pair ripped the first day of wearing them. Horrible material.,1,74
"They are too small compared to the picture, i was so disappointed",1,65
Hat fine.  Decal cheap and hard to read.,1,40
"These glasses are not good. The nose piece is far too narrow for my nose or anyone else with a normal-sized nose. These are also very oversized, so even if they did fit, I would feel like I had bug eyes. Very disappointed with these.",1,233
Very cheaply made. Wouldn’t recommend,1,37
LED didn't work,1,15
It was either defected or the poorly translated instructions were impossible to follow. I had to return it.,1,107
Nothing to see out if couldn’t wear it,1,38
i couldn't even button up my pants i order a size up there run to to small that im about too pop,1,96
I've only added these to my stainless steel charm bracelet YESTERDAY and already 2 have popped off. The lobster claw is still attached but the the jump ring and word.... gone. 😒,1,177
please don't waste your money,1,29
The worst buy. Broke on first day,1,33
"Do not buy these.  They are glittered covered cardboard on a thin plastic wire.  Like something you’d get at the dollar store, for 10x the price.",1,145
"Very, very thin material.<br />Would not wear in public.",1,56
Product arrived damaged out of the box.  Huge disappointment!!,1,62
too small and not good quality,1,30
"This belt does not tie easily at all, and is consistently coming loose all day.",1,79
"Bought two pair. First pair the zipper broke, second pair the belt loop broke. Both brakes happened first time wearing them. Cheap! Don’t purchase. Save your money.",1,164
The sleeves are extremely small. I bought a men's 3x and the sleeves were too small so I gave it to my mom who is a woman's 2x-3x. She also found the arm holes wayyy too small.,1,176
"Slightly disappointed,  purchased this cool little wallet and I have to say, the first two days the phone charged perfectly.. third day and to date no charge at all..",1,166
I've had this for 6 days.  I have worn it non stop. This morning I noticed that the stone was missing. I guess it's just glued in the setting and not actually set in the bezel.  bummer.,1,185
I was deteriorating very fast,1,29
It's a women's shirt not for men the cut on the neck is not correct,1,67
Straight out of the box and the product is defective — glue coming loose at the seams. Also one slide is not the same size as the other. Reject product and to add salt to injury they charge you to return their defective item.,1,225
Cute but my daughter complained that scarf and hat was itchy,1,60
I hate this bag. In the picture it looks like it's stiff and downs flop over. But it's very flimsy and is not stiff like the picture. Disappointed,1,146
It’s cute but not for me.. maybe my granny?,1,43
I’m a 1X/2X and got a XXL and it is way too small. Sizing not right,1,67
"Very cheap. Very thin. Great for children, not so much for adults. Run very small. Waste of my money.",1,101
Band cracked and broke,1,22
nothing  like the picture once i open the bag it smells like ocean had bad fish smell to it about to send it back<br />waste time and money was for husband anniversary  but i pass on this nothing like pictures waste of 💵,1,220
"This is the worst-made product I've ever received. The seams weren't straight, it's way too big in some areas and small in others. I literally cut it up and am using it for rags. I DO NOT recommend this item if you plan to actually wear it. Looks nothing as it appears in the photo.",1,282
Super cheap quality item. Very disappointed!,1,44
Both bracelets broke within one day. Super cheap and cheesy,1,59
These were advertised as 5.5mm across. The pair I received were less than 2mm each. Disappointed; don't buy.,1,108
I was very disappointed I've ordered these before and never had a problem<br />This time they were scratched and bent,1,117
"If you are buying these for kids older than five, buy the adult size.  These are very small.",2,92
Weird fit. The straps are sewn too short so it rises very high on your back and looks odd. Synthetic material makes it hard to “breathe” through but it is flown and that helps. I wouldn’t recommend it since the fit is so odd.,2,225
Not Thermal more of Pajamas,2,27
These socks do not stay up.,2,27
"When I first received this I absolutely loved it. I liked how I could keep my car key on a separate end from my other keys. Unfortunately, in the first picture you'll see how once the tiny screw's end fell off it just fell apart. I now have two separate keychains. Not what I was going for.",2,290
"Very disappointed in the poor quality. I figured it would be PU Leather and not Genuine Leather as advertised, but it was plastic. The red color dyed plastic material rubbed off easily. I sent it back to amazon. One thing nice about it was the design.",2,251
The fabric good quality but the sewing and manufacturing very poor,2,66
Cheap Quality.,2,14
"Decent quality materials, sizing is awkward, very large in the chest and very small in the waist/hips. I sized up and it does not fit.",2,134
Not dark enough and the lens already fell out,2,45
"The material was great, super soft and stretchy. However, at 5'9&#34; with a long torso, this was a flop. Camel toe (never cute), and the legs were too short. Gave to my petite cousin, and she rocked it.",2,203
"I got a large and I usually wear a large in hoodies and sweatshirts. I read the reviews, wanted a loose fit but this hung way down past my butt and the pockets are the same material so really bulgy. Not a flattering look. But super soft. I returned it.",2,252
The material is not flattering and it's very thin. Cute neckline.,2,65
"This is complicated.  I ordered size medium, the package that they come in says medium, but the tags on two out of the three briefs says small.  The third one says medium.  And all three briefs seem to be the same size and they are all too small.  So, I think that I received three small briefs.",2,295
"These look lovely from a distance, but they are very cheaply made I don't think they will last very long.",2,105
"Inflexible....hard to read, hard to wrap and smelly.  Not really worth the money...sorry to say.  I had to send it back.",2,120
Its ok. Nothing special. The material is hard and will take some time breaking into.,2,84
"Shirt fit fine, but the fabric is &#34;weird, cheap, unnatural&#34; and whatever else the other bad reviewers said. I'm thinking it should be remarketed as a swim top or some nonsense. Returned it.",2,197
"There are a lot of counterfeit pins in this lot. Only one was found to be a genuine Disney pin. The selections were decent, but most of them had to be scrapped. I just wished the item description stated that they were copies and not original products.",2,251
"Gets 2 stars for cuteness and that's all it has to offer....weird fit, unable to tighten it up.",2,95
"Hated the collar, doesn't lay properly.",2,39
"I purchased this shirt for work. It doesn't look sheer in the pictures, but it is actually sheer. I cannot wear a sheer shirt to work. Also, the fabric is rough and horrible and it felt awful on my skin. I returned it.",2,218
"These have a satiny feel and are loose fitting. Buy a size down if you want a tighter fit. Length is fine for me, but probably a bit short for most people.",2,155
"Runs a size small, returned it got a bigger size, it ran too big. No happy medium. Its an okay dress, It just didn't really fit my body that well.",2,146
The bottoms are somewhat smaller than expected.  The top was much larger than expected (I double checked the tag to make sure they were sized the same).  They is at least a size or two difference between the top and bottom.,2,223
"Was very aesthetically pleasing upon arrival, however One month later it lost its color and tarnished.<br />Looks completely rusted black now.",2,142
Quality of material is good but the legs are way too tight on my son- 14 year old regifted to his younger brother who is 9 and the legs fit him although the waist is way too big for a 9 year old (he says he will wear a belt-),2,225
It feels and looks great but the stitching on the inside started ripping the first day.,2,87
Did not fit like the picture. Looks more like a Thomas Jefferson wig. My child is 2.5.,2,86
"The fabric was a little weird, I received the product very quickly - just didn't like the quality of the fabric or the way it fit to my body. gave me an old lady butt",2,166
I don't know any normal woman who could wear this. It is SO tiny. It's nice but useless and not worth the trouble to return. It also took way to long to get it. Very unhappy.,2,174
Very cheaply made!,2,18
Slightly too small. Size isn't accurate,2,39
"Silver foil...not rhinestones...and not suitable for speaking. It's too short. If I move my mouth, the mask will slip off.",2,122
"I dislike that not all the initials were even on counts, didn't get V some were more than others",2,96
I followed the measurements on the fitting guide. And when I got it and tried it on it was way too big. Super sad!!!,2,116
I didn’t like the material.  The pockets stuck out like I had large softballs in the sides.  I ordered a size up so maybe that was why.  The skirt did not arrive pleated as portrayed in the photo either. I ended up returning it.,2,228
lacking in color and style,2,26
Cute! Sized wrong.,2,18
One of the pieces was missing a crown (cannot set the time). Otherwise as expected.,2,83
"For the most part, I could really like these, but they have a design flaw in that when folded closed, the temple ends hit the inside of the lens, scratching them. I'm going to put molefoam on the ends that rest behind the ear in an attempt to reduce further damage to the lenses.",2,279
They are way to long for me,2,27
"I got this today and the color of the sweatshirt is different from the logo, no matching as the photo of the product depicts. Seems like a nice sweat shirt but it did seem big and larger than a XL should be. I would order a size smaller",2,236
"I am between an L & XL too, got and XL and it was tight in the stomach area. Also busty...34DD, straps did not support well. Not for busty women or those with post-baby tummy.... had to return",2,192
They do not hold up my heavy DDD breasts,2,40
Ok for the price.,2,17
"Bought for my daughter to use with a dress.  She did not like it, so we returned.  It is extremely small...so consider sizing up when ordering.",2,143
Cute but turned fingers green quickly.,2,38
They were too small of a size of shoes I got,2,44
the  sleeves were short and not true to it size I ordered a large,2,65
"Not what I thought . .  OK Music.<br /><br />Joel Weldon is one of America's great motivational speakers, but the music is just OK.",2,131
Pretty glasses but stick wayyy off of my face I love big glasses these just didn't fit me right.,2,96
The bag seemed nice.  I put a 23 pound folding bike in it and checked it with my airline.  Fit great but the bag quickly developed holes.  It's thin and not for heavier objects.  Use for lite duty carrying of posters from office to office maybe.  Careful setting it down.,2,271
"Looks nice . Very heavy, what  I don't like.",2,44
"Small watch, this is meant for a kid, the watch face itself is not much bigger than a postage stamp.",2,100
Super cheap in person. Looks much better on the model. Boxy fit. Returned mine.,2,79
I bought for my 5 year old. She is always saying her hands are still cold,2,73
Loved them until 3rd wash zipper broke. Only 1 week into wearing. If that didn't happen these would have been my favorite pair of pants hands down. For you military or LEO guys You'll find these super comfy.,2,207
"I thought these would be very nice conservative reading glasses, but the frames are so thick that I look like Harry Caray when I wear them.<br />The photo really didn't convey that as well as I wished.",2,201
The elastic came off on certain area I had to sew it.,2,53
Honestly for the price these are total junk. I think they’re plastic- like even the “metal” part. They look and feel like those little toys you get out of a quarter dispenser for kids.,2,184
After the first washing it started falling apart at the seams,2,61
I was disappointed that you couldn’t see the super heroes.,2,58
"The dress look cheap bad quality fabric and is no sew right and the sizes are wrong , this one is to big for me and they don't have smaller sizes,  mean it to return it but I lost the Bag so I guess I can't do it now .",2,218
Very pretty its a shame it broke on the second day.I put It  back together and it broke in a different place and cant be fixed.,2,127
"The shorts shipped very fast and were very reasonably priced. Follows the saying you get what you paid for. Last minute Christmas gift for my hubby. They were way to big, they went down to his ankles. They were much bigger than other shorts of the same size, like twice the size.",2,279
"Fit was fine, material was cheep and not breathable",2,51
The image is not printed on the shirt but a very rubbery blurred image that is heat pressed on. The image was applied crooked too. Not recommend.,2,145
"Very beautiful looks like the picture but the hook broke within a week, metal piece was very thin and seemed poorly made",2,120
The LED stopped working after the third day but I was able return the and seller refunded the money.  My daughter loved them but it was unfortunate that they were defective.,2,173
"They are 100 percent not authentic. They’re good quality, but the glasses say made in Japan. So the price is outrageous for a fake pair of glasses. Buyers be aware.",2,164
"This is a very nice hat, very well made., however it is extremely hard and not comfortable to me.",2,97
"Stiff material, kinda frumpy looking",2,36
"I am giving a 2 star rating ,  heavy on the ear , and I thought I would receive a pair .....nice for a special occasion if I had 2",2,130
Very cute but tight,2,19
Thin material. Not what I expected.  Also size is way smaller than a standard size,2,82
won't hold 17&#34; computer,2,27
Terrible design and see through.,2,32
Supper soft and pretty colors BUT they are a little too snug and short. I could use a XL but they only come in one size:(,2,121
For someone with really small arms. Not really stretchy material.,2,65
"I'm tall and thin, this was way to big",2,38
The material is adorable and soft but the sizing is way off. I order a 6-12 and they are huge on my childm they fit like a 2t,2,125
Didn't fit as expected.,2,23
"The gloves seem fine, but they got here much later than I expected them too, and so I didn't even get to use them for what I bought them for.",2,141
"although the item delivered on time, the quality of the clothing is not good.<br />i've chosen the small size, it's still too big.<br />it's more like a pj when i tried it on.<br />impossible to wear this out.",2,209
Broke first time it was worn.,2,29
"When they arrived and didn’t have pockets, I double checked the listing to make sure the listing photos had pockets. Honestly, I won’t wear them much because they don’t have pockets. That’s disappointing.",2,204
"Thicker than expected. The fabric sucks to your face when you inhale. Not nearly as colorful as pictured, only a few bright colored sequins. The seam runs right down the middle so it is pointy & boxy looking.",2,208
They fall off of the hard pads that are built into my glasses. They need to have some adhesive built in to the pas. Only lasted about a weeik!,2,142
"Leather is not leather, pink is not pink it is flesh colored.....?",2,66
Not as cute as it looks in the picture. It's also an awkward size. I don't think I will ever use it for anything.,2,113
Bought these for my daughter but there was no way she could wear them. Far too small.,2,85
Somewhat disappointing... the cross slips out and necklace falls off! I have almost lost it so afraid to wear it anymore.,2,121
"I have this necklace it's really pretty but one of my stones in the center was missing when I got it. N i thru out the information to returns u have nbeen t wore it, very disappointed.",2,184
They made it to  small in the chest I always buy this size,2,58
"I don't know how no other reviews mention that the lining of the front pockets show through the pants as if there were socks tucked down the front. There is no way at all to hide this. Big, bulky lines. Really disappointed.",2,223
Feels too heavy on my nose - not comfortable to wear for long periods of time.,2,78
"these worked okay, comfortable, not too hot. but they ripped on the first use and I'm an athletic male with semi slender feet.",2,126
Don't stay on ears,2,18
"Was bought as a gift for a Navy mom in June, the thing just fell completely apart. Just looked at the order - it was ordered June 22, the window for returns was June 24....really?? And how do I get ahold of these people about a warranty or something? Barely lasted 3 months??!!!",2,278
"Runs small, cheaply made, too small for my 4 year old.",2,54
The earnings are so cute but one just refuses to go in the pearl.,2,65
"The retention ends kept opening up and catching on clothing. Yes, I could push them back down but really annoying to have to do that!",2,133
The top was tight in the shoulders making arm<br />Movement hard,2,64
"I can’t put these on! They are so difficult to put on, I don’t know if it’s me. I really like them, but won’t be able to wear them.",2,131
No lo compraría otra vez,2,24
Although this looks super cute sizing it as a 6 to 12 months is insane! It is more like an 18 month size and the width of the onesie looks like it could fit a 2t!,2,162
"I read many of the reviews on this dress and with that in mind, I ordered a large. Too large for my chest (36c). I tried to imagine it fitting properly, so I could reorder, but I couldn't. I returned it and did not order another.",2,229
The seems across the front Don't lay flat when its on.,2,54
Legs were far too short. V-neck too low. Returned,2,49
"The shirt itself is pretty, but the material is just awful.",2,59
"Tiny, Had to give to my little sister",2,37
The colors did not match the picture so I returned it immediately.  Decent quality though.,2,90
"The first time I wore the socks I got a nice blister within 5 miles, and had to end my hike early. I like the sock in general for the gym or whatever... but they didn't prevent any blisters...",2,192
I love the style. My only reason for a 2 star review is that half the chain just fell off. It fell off in the package before I could even open it.,2,146
They’re fine quality shirts however if you have a size D chest or larger DO NOT get this product. It puckers at the bust and almost doesn’t button.,2,147
The mechanism to close the umbrella did not work properly. I returned it.,2,73
"They look good.  No problem there, and I expected these to be light (cheap) due to the price, but I found the openings too small for my nipples.  Oh well.",2,154
"Super cute and love them, but I was sent the wrong size.... Ordered a 4 and got a 2 so my sister (who they were gifted to) has them just sitting in a box. .",2,156
The watch looks nice but my husband had it on one day when it rained and water got inside the face of the watch. It is supposed to be water resistant so I wouldn’t expect rainfall to cause moisture under the glass. Disappointing…,2,229
Smaller on top than the measurements would indicate.It may work for my daughter.,2,80
The glasses didn't seem to be sturdy. Flimsy sides and cheap plastic for $50. The screws come out after two days of use.,2,120
"Its nice, but the material is all hand wash an it just hangs on me i am 5’5 an 115lbs i should of gotten a small size",2,117
"Too small for a large, gave it to a friend because it’s inconvenient to return , the purpose of online is yo not go out.",2,120
Ordered 1.5 sizes larger than I typically wear and still had a side seen blow out within 5 minutes of wear,2,106
The jumper  looks better online  than it does in real like. Slightly cheap looking. I couldn’t do it. I have an image!! Returned!,2,129
Too long and made for tall people,2,33
"It came in early, but the entire right portion was cracked off, only held on by the band.",2,89
"I do not like the fit of these leggings. I thought they were similar to another pair of RBX leggings I currently own but they aren't. For me, this pairs tummy flattening panel hits too high and is uncomfortable. I would return them but I already trashed the tags.",2,263
"Did not like it! Well I did until the minute I put it on, it stoped working... Now I just have a braclet so I'm very unhappy kuz I totally needed a watch",2,153
Said it fit my watch brand (Garmin) but it did not.,2,51
"Very stylish, but I dont think these are 1.5 readers, I cant see a thing with them on.",2,86
"Sizes run small, perfect for littler ankle sizes, breaks fairly easily. You get what you pay for.",2,97
Looks bigger not happy with the size,2,36
Cute but strap broke after only a few wears and my daughter was very upset cause she loved this outfit.,2,103
"Nice garment, however there is a hole in the seam  of the neckline.  Not too bad right not but could spread as washed, worn, and dried. I 'm not much of a seamstress,  so doubt I can fix it. Any suggestions?",2,207
I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and these are still too small.  They are shorter than usual and fitted.  I would order up at least 2 sizes.  Other than that they are of goo quality.,2,194
The color is not at all as pictured. I ordered purple but what I got is an ugly maroon. The case is also misaligned.,2,116
The skirt is too short. The green in the shirt didn't match the green on the skirt.,2,83
"Way smaller than expected, can't see design at all",2,50
Very tight as seen in the image. My stomach is popping out. Felt a heave of relief when I changed my dress. phew,2,112
I do not recommend this product. I have bought a lot from this company and this is the only shirt a I not recommend. It seems they just pieced fabric together and sold it!,2,171
"The coloring is more brown them pink, which was disappointing.",2,62
Balls fall off easily.,2,22
"Great quality, bad fit. The band is tight but there's too much space on the top.",2,80
"Taking their sizing variance into account, I ordered 2xl - normally XL.  It’s short waisted - empire at best. I am 5’4” & in flats I’m stepping on the hem.",2,155
"The top is short so only but if you want your midriff showing. Also, it is not cotton.",2,86
BAD QUALITY!! DOESNT WORTH A PENNY!!! IF I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK I WOULD HAVE REQUESTED A REFUND!!,2,100
It says plus size..... but they are super small wouldn’t even make it onto my thigh with out digging in. Disappointed -_-,2,121
Did not really reflect what the picture showed and it was way too short even though I bought it two sizes bigger.,2,113
Totally see-through!  The belt is not great quality.,2,52
[[VIDEOID:6f4524295e6d077c875d7a63b223e87f]] I’ve only worn this once and the stitching is already falling apart! Cute dress besides the stitching all coming undone,2,164
Pros-The cut is smooth and the earrings are light weight.<br />Cons-The image is blurry and VERY faded. Unless someone is 6 inches from my head they won't know what it is.,2,171
"Beautiful, soft fabric.....however, NOT high quality as the seem under the bust was very noticeably crooked once the dress was tried on. Unfortunately, now I have to deal with a return.",2,185
I gave it two stars because I ordered and paid for a 2-pack black/burgundy heather. The package I received had only the burgundy heather. I’d like to know where is my black jogger.,2,180
There’s no reflecting light o any other way to see the time with low light,2,74
"Much to small to even get my foot into, company was great to work with concerning my problem.",2,93
These fell apart right away. The dragon fell of right away.,2,59
I received my clicker 2 days ago and I was so happy when I got it but the jewel has already fallen out and I'm really disappointed. Kind of feel like I wasted my money.,2,168
IT smells horrible !<br />And I buy everything from amazon down to socks !<br /><br />Okay so I wear size small and I bought this for a friend who wears us L<br />No........ it fits me! If you buy this order like 4 sizes bigger and wash it real good because uffff!,2,264
"The material is nice, but they're much shorter than shown.",2,58
Most of them are way too big.,2,29
Ordered an XL but fits like a Medium.  I like the shirt but have to return it.,2,78
This product is not 100% cotton. It's 85% polyester 15% linen,2,61
"Fit and size are perfect! Unfortunately in a couple beach days the elastic wore out a bit around the waist. It is still wearable as the drawstring works, but it just fits a little different.",2,190
"Beware, they turn your fingers green. Each one of them.",2,55
They r nice but they bend easily . Ive had to buy like 7 of them because they keep bending or the nose piece moves out of place and i cant deal with uneven glasses . Definately cant just throw them in your bag and go .,2,218
"These earrings are so cute, I put the stone one in and immediately caught an infection. They are not surgical steel. If your allergic to fake jewelry don’t buy. Plastic one was awesome for my surgery procedure",2,209
Love the color but size too small,2,33
"Pretty shirt but the shirt looks like it would be long based on the picture, but it isn't.  It barely comes over the waist.  The picture is very misleading.",2,156
"Material is a heavier quality however it looks shiny similar to a satin type finish. Not what I was expectingl, it looks cheap in my opinion. Will be returning.",2,160
This item was Small & very thin<br />It definitely will not make through a wash cycle.<br />Looks as if it’ll be hand wash only.,2,128
"Not what I expected,. Cheapl material,",2,38
"I ordered these to wear to a color specific wedding, the muted purple tone was perfect for what I needed. When I received the earrings they were not that color at all. They were white and slightly see through. They also just looked a little cheap. Won’t be purchasing from this seller again.",2,291
I liked everything about the pants but the length. I'm 5 foot 7 inches talk and the XL are about 5inches too long,2,113
"Too tight on my ear, but pretty",2,31
A 3X fits as an XL. I ordered it extra big but it was not true to size. Good thing a do wear an XL so it still fits but it’s not giving what I needed it to give.,2,161
"On the very first wash, the bandana had strings unraveling on all four sides. Hand wash only or they will start unraveling. Otherwise, they are larger and work better as a bandana if the smaller ones won't fit your head.",2,220
Around the chest fit good but cup size was way too big.,2,55
Great length and sheer. Except the crochet on the chest (muted earth tone pastel) and the trim on the sleeves (florescent) were totally different! Just looks like a mess. :( bummed bc it was the right length.,2,208
"good looking and comfortable belt. Leather is genuine.<br />But pay attention. This belt has the bleeding dye. For example, my jeans Wrangler is dyed after the first wearing of this belt. And if take into account that this jeans is light colour...",2,247
The sweater feels like someone knitted  it at home -while it looks nice it feels very cheap,2,91
Not flattering at all. Returned,2,31
Very cute and fit well.  Very thin material,2,43
The blue pair fit perfectly but the white and black pair were small and did nothing for butt lift.,2,98
this style looks MUCH different in person.,2,42
these are so soft and seem to be great quality but they run so comically large that I can't comment on the fit. for reference I usually fall between a small and a medium depending on fit/brand/style/etc. I purchased a medium but id need an XS which I don't think exists. 3/10,2,275
Product is not what they claim. There is no control top and they are very poor quality. I had runs in my nylon with in 20 minutes of wearing them.,2,146
Thia was too tight in the arms and chest but it fit mostly every where. I did not like how short it was I like my shirts to be a little longer. The material was good just not enough for me,2,188
Read all the reviews which indicated shirt ran small so I ordered a large.  It is huge.  Gave it away.,2,102
"Pilled immediately, unsightly after 1 wearing. Then they shrank. Not best pleased.",2,82
Sizing was too large to wear.  Had to return them.  Material was also very thin.,2,80
The pink was a very bright salmon color. Didn’t look like the pic very well at all. But the fit was good.,2,105
"Too bulky, it does not spin from the sides",2,42
The pants have a plastic-y feel.,2,32
Way too tight-- could not get it over my head. My mother is a size 10/12 and she couldn't it over her head either. Too bad. It was pretty.,2,138
It broke in less then 3 month,2,29
Looked pretty but definitely not true to size,2,45
Nice dress but the sizing is way off. I am giving it away,2,57
The quality wasn't great. The socks also began to stretch after just trying them on. They are thick though.,2,107
I measured based on their sizing  chart efore I purchased and they were still too small. Hope the next size up fits because they are beautiful gloves,2,149
The graphic on the t-shirt was cracked when it finally arrived later than stated when purchased.  The size is almost a size and a half small.,2,141
Not as universal as it is described.,2,36
Like wearing a large thin scarf. Not worth  it.,2,47
"I like the hat but I am not happy, the inside of the bill of the hat seems to be bigger than the outside liner because it is bumpy. it doesn't look nice nor pretty. I don't know where or how to returned it.<br />My e-mail is: yanitza2004@gmail.com<br />Thank you",2,262
The glasses are a great color of read and the case is nice that's all that is good about the glasses. My grandson is 5 year old and the glasses are huge on him. The lens are almost adult size and the frames are very wide. I would not recommend to purchase them.,2,261
"I am 5'2"" 100lbs I bought a size small and the outfit is too big.",2,65
The grey shorts part of seem was not fully sewn up,2,50
It was smaller than I expected plus picture shows it oval and I got a circle but it's still nice,2,96
The band's retainer pin would not stay in place and my watch kept falling off.,2,78
"Fabric is nice, but gives you a mad camel-toe",2,45
Can see everything plain as day,2,31
This appears like a sweatshirt in the picture  and states sweatshirt on the description. It is more of a long sleeve T-shirt. I was wanting something warm so I returned it. If you want a light weight long sleeve shirt then you may like it.,2,239
This fit super wierd. Returned it.,2,34
Disappointed to say the least  looks like wish crap.<br />I ordered a 2xl  it's like a kids 2xl<br />I can barely get it on and no way it will zip<br />It does heat up ok,2,170
"I bought this for girls weekend, so wasn't needing anything perfect, but the quality is very far from perfect.  Will need to shape and iron it in the hopes it will even look remotely close to a captain's hat.  Was very smushed up and bent in packaging.  But I suppose you get what you pay for.",2,293
"I received the dress yesterday, ordered a XL, i am disappointed, it looks cheaply made, definitely not what I was expecting also it is rose gold not gold",2,153
Way too small! Tried both a small and medium.,2,45
Wife returned them as they were to small and very scratchy.,2,59
"cheaper and flimsier than I thought, but I guess I should have suspected as such for the price",2,94
Cheap cheap. Seams are not lined up. Elbow patches not in right place. Very thin.,2,81
iT HAS ALREADY SLOWED DOWN; ONE WEEK AFTER PURCHASE.,2,52
Size is way off and material for all 3 shirts are different. I was very unhappy with my purchase,2,96
cheap just like the price and the color turned it looks dirty.,2,62
"Super pretty and fit great except for the arms, very tight",2,58
I got a size larger than I normally would and the only thing that fit properly were the bottoms. The skirt wrap was a handkerchief at best and to say the top had minimal coverage is an understatement. I’ve seen better coverage with pasties.,2,240
So disappointed in sizing. It was NOT XL.,2,41
"it was nice, just didn't like how it looked on me, I'm petite :(",2,64
"I bought this because my daughter was Minnie Mouse this Halloween and wore her costume every day to shreds. She loves being a Minnie Mouse princess so I had hoped to swap out the dress, but this dress was the old model, not as well made, and not as pretty. My daughter refused to wear it.",2,288
Screw that holds the Focus portion on the ball easily works out. Had to use a thread lock product to keep it together.,2,118
Very costume and cheap,2,22
It's really cute and looks good but was incredibly hard to put on because of the design. It was painful to put in my rook piercing and painful to take out .,2,156
"Cheap, don't waste your money.",2,30
Very cute but the bottoms are see thru.,2,39
Fit was large and unflattering on me. Fabric seemed cheaply made. Looks great in the photos though!,2,99
Broke very easily. This gift only lasted about a week and a half before it snapped. It looked great while it lasted.,2,116
"The band was super cute, and I really wanted to use it but it would not firmly attach to my Versa 3. I had to return the band because it would not stay attached to my device.",2,174
"Small fit, would not lace up properly",2,37
Not the best dress. Difficult for me to assemble with the ropes in the back. I ended up returning it because I just couldn’t manage it.,2,135
"The logo is off center and faded... it's like they were trying to save ink. It's hard to tell when buying online, especially clothing. but, overall it's a good around the house shirt. I would never wear it in public with the off-kilter logo.",2,241
I purchased for my 2 year old however although they are adjustable I would say their more suitable for older kids. However they are still a good quality.,2,153
"Need to list what the metal is in the product. Not allergic to silicone, but the metal clasp caused an allergic reaction.",2,121
Didn't know that these were safety glasses. NOT what I wanted,2,61
The shirt is very cute BUT I ordered a small and what came was HUGE! I’m returning it.,2,86
the satin pleats weren't what i expected,2,40
Coolong lasts for a VERY short time.,2,36
"The symbol is too small, You cannot see it at all.  The picture showed 3 rings in 3 different colors. There is just one.",2,120
"Looks nice, but it was cheap material.",2,38
"Got the light black which has tiny glitter all over it. Fit is a bit loose. Ruffles seem to make the wrong spots look bigger, wider which for  5’4 does not flatter.  Itchy material. Returning",2,191
"Very fragile, snapped within first few weeks of use despite care in storing.",2,76
Too bulky and very awkward to handle.  Forget about ever getting the cover on again unless you have plenty of time.  Donated it.,2,128
very cheaply produced -  Disappointed,2,37
Buy it 2 sizes too small. Their size charts are very flawed,2,59
"Creí que podía ser un poco más desahoga pero la verdad es que no. Siento que me quedo un poco grande de hombros y las mangas mi hablar, súper largas. No es de mala calidad pero no quedé satisfecha con el producto, lo peor es que que la pedí rosada!",2,248
These boots are cute and good quality but they are SO tight. I have thin feet and went a half size up and these were still too tight for me,2,139
Braclet came in broken. Super glue will fix that and the clasp holding the material together on the necklace came apart. All fixable just annoying,2,146
"This fit as expected, but it appeared to be made pretty cheaply. The fabric surrounding the holes at the top was a different shade of green from the rest of the dress. The skirt was too full for my liking. The fabric felt like a shower curtain. I returned this dress.",2,267
"They're heavy in the front. So can't wear for a long time.<br />To read while lying down, items can't be flat on your lap; they must be upright. I expected items could lay flat to read while lying down. Disappointed in this.",2,224
The headband is adorable but the gems that are supposed to be on the flowers fall off.,2,86
"I loved this belt when it is new. However, little less than a year, holes on the belt getting bigger and bigger. Now, the belt just cannot hold properly!",2,153
Strap broke in just under a month. Not worth the money and time,2,63
Doesn't fit right,2,17
I didn't like how short it was in the back and long in the front I ended up giving it to a different person,2,107
The Jump rings holding the extension are too weak and I have already lost the extender!,2,87
The shoes look great but its a bit heavy for my kids to wear. The size came smaller so we suggest anyone to buy a bigger size than your average.,2,144
"They feel like exactly what they are, cheap material poorly stitched together. I used them for one day of work and they didn't last the day... I was hoping these would be a cheaper alternative to my Mechanix gloves which have only recently started to show wear after years of use",2,279
"I was hoping this skirt was a real high waist style that I can wear to an event but the material and style was just average.<br />It was very thin, maybe for the summer as a casual skirt but the photo gave the impression it was a more dressy.",2,242
Runs a little small and the fabric is very stiff.,2,49
They do not stay up. After wearing a couple of times they start to look bad,2,75
did not last very long started fraying within days would recommend not buying these,2,83
"The material on this is a very heavy almost shiny material. I loved the design, but the  execution of the design was off. I had to send it back. The very top is build small and there is a tents worth of material after that.",2,223
The top  was WAY too small.  Got a 2x for my mom standard size for her and it fit her like a medium.  She gave it to  me and it fit me around the arms like a large. SO Not true to size . And I did use the sizing chart.,2,218
It'll make you look pregnant. Trying to figure out how to make this shirt work.,2,79
"I ordered XXL when I am normally an XL. Was sent an XL which is too tight in the hips and too small in the breast areas. When went back to order the XXL, it was no longer there. This has had to me two other times when ordering XXL! If you don't have XXLs then say you don't have it",2,281
The eyes in the picture are dark (black or blue) but the earrings don't have dark eyes. Returned these,2,102
"Cool hat, but it fits like those hats that the old vets wear.  It sits on your head with at least 1&#34; between the top of your head and the lid,  The bill is already formed as well",2,182
"I love this case because the pattern was really cute. Unfortunately, after being thrown in my purse, the back was all scratched up and it looked cheap. I had to replace after a few weeks.",2,187
"All advice regarding sizing was to order a size smaller, at least. This proved to be incorrect in my case.<br /><br />My normal size is extra large and I ordered large instead. It was too small. I returned the product and am waiting for my refund.",2,247
I wanted to love this but it was a bit clingy and the color/pattern was not as pretty in person. Returned.,2,106
"This is a beautiful belt, and the metal work is wonderful. However, my daughter wore it for ONE DAY and it was falling apart. All the blue was cracked and coming off, and she can't wear it anymore because it's just destroyed. Don't waste your money.",2,249
Pretty but huge,2,15
"I do like the attached earplugs.  However, the goggles fog up CONSTANTLY and leak a bit.  Not bad, but could be a lot better",2,124
Had to return.  They didn't fit.,2,32
"They don't close well, I lost one of them first time I used it,disappointed",2,75
cheap.,2,6
"One important positive is that this item was packaged and mailed very quickly during a holiday period. Much appreciated! The scarf is disappointing. The material looks and feels 'cheap' and the designs/logos are not crisp or sharp. It is fleece, but it is not a good quality.",2,275
I return them,2,13
We ordered these for basketball they run small,2,46
Runs small and I didn't like the fabric quality.,2,48
Doesnt stay on,2,14
"So it fits i guess. However, if your looking for a strapless bandeau bra, it has absolutely no support. So anyone with big boobs I do not suggest if your looking for support.",2,174
Works but looks rather cheap. I found another company that makes absolutely BEAUTIFUL replacement bands. Too bad it's not on Amazon!,2,132
Very cute but the side seam ripped after wearing once,2,53
"They are like plastic, served the purpose for a one time wear...not wearing them again.",2,87
"The material feels really cheap and is quite  hot.  The top ruffle rolls up and does not lay well.  The colors and design and sizing are exactly as described, it's just not very wearable.",2,187
"These things hurt! They work fine, but the hard plastic of the entire product cuts the sides of your tongue and your gums whenever you retract or push out the fangs. I would not recommend this product, even if it's just for one night, such as Halloween.",2,253
The connection to charge broke after the first week.  Very disappointed.,2,72
Light doesnt light up the screen...,2,35
"I bought it, and it fits so well I bought another.<br /><br />The next one I got was not the same type that I got the first time. It was a different product that fit,terribly.",2,175
Won't fit on ear.,2,17
The bracelets are not even made with soft thread. They are hard and the knots constantly come undone. The bracelets are also very big and become loose almost immediately after tightening. Don't waste your money on these.,2,220
This bathing suit is super cute. The top fit great.<br />The bottoms not so much. They are not high waisted at all they fit more like bikini bottoms.,2,149
"Looks good but probably because it made in china,  it;s too short on torso and I only 5.5.",2,90
So cute but horrible quality.  It broke the first day I wore it :(,2,66
Great product but after one full shift the Velcro adjustable strap on the right club started to rip off and the touchscreen won’t respond to the right and I can bring,2,166
"Whatever your size, get one or two sizes larger.  I got the large for someone who wears medium and yet it would not fit her at all.  It is more like a child's large.",2,165
"Purchased several in different colors same size. They all fit different. Some tight in the chest some not, some loose in the arms and others too tight. Some longer and some shorter. None are consistently cut. They're certainly not the Russells of a few years ago.",2,263
The lenses are paper thin.<br />The frames have rough edges from not shaping from the mold.,2,91
"Extremely sheer, fell apart the first time I wore it. I had to re-sew all the seam. Still a very cute style.",2,108
"Front part is shorter than I thought it would be, don't like the fit. Maybe cute on someone else but it seem awkward and weird. Not quite what I expected. Also fit was somewhat small.",2,183
"There's simply NO way this is 50L. It's more like 25, if even that. It felt like a toy your kid would use for kindergarten. Avoid this pack. Get an Osprey instead. That's rated Top Ten by Backpacking Magazine.",2,209
small than actual size.,2,23
"too cheap, and too small. Made with small asian sizes in mind. I am 5&#34;7 125lbs and a cup ... it didn't fit.",2,111
Not a vibrant blue pretty for the price came quickly,2,52
"Ordered white gloves.  Package is marked white, but gloves are beige at best.  They fit nice but they aren't the color I ordered.",2,129
Did not fit like I was expecting.,2,33
"This will be going back.  We bought this for a halloween scene and discovered that in order for this to run, it also plays sound (and it is really freaking loud).  Not what I wanted.",2,182
"It worked, but didn't fit my face right",2,39
Looked like I was wearing a sack.,2,33
I am done buying from China.  The delivery time is long and the quality is short.<br />The center stone is small and has no sparkle.  The 'crystals' that surround it look like glass.<br />The chain is not substantial.  There is a reason jewelry is cheap. It's not even worth the low price.,2,289
Neck of shirt fit however!!!! The rest of the shirt was huge.  I ended up having to take up the entire shirt. 4 stars however for the tie & cummerbund and the quality of the material of the shirt.,2,196
Awkward shape.,2,14
The stones had fallen out when I opened the box was not happy,2,61
I got an L and I wished I would’ve sized down the chest area was sooo big. I had to return,2,90
This is more of like a hoodie than a coat or jacket. Really disappointed!,2,73
can't take pic through the plastic,2,34
Very tight fitting.,2,19
The shorts are fine the shorts are short and super soft I didn’t get a headband. I did get a little cotton tail to pin on the shorts if I want. HOWEVER the top is wayyyy too small I got a size large if you have double ds and up this top is most definitely not for you.,2,268
Cans leaked.  This has been going on for a while now.  Red Wing can't find leak proof tops?,2,91
"They're made of a comfortable material, but feel a bit on the small side and the legs constantly ride up throughout the day. They need constant adjustment throughout the day in order to be comfortable and not have all of the material in the leg rolled up next to your crotch.",2,275
Very thin pretty much see through,2,33
"it is a nice dress. it fit fine. my issue was related to the material.  it is not a natural material. it is synthetic. therefore, it is misleading to call it only a cotton-linen mix.",2,182
Cheap!!! Not worth it!,2,22
Shirts ride up. They run small. I ordered a 3x when I normally wear a 2x.,2,73
Worn once a week for about 7 months buttons on the pockets fall off easily and the zipper started tearing out today never had a zipper tear out on any pants ever,2,161
Ordered my daughter's a 14/16 and they looked like toddler shorts,2,65
Watch isn't working.  I think the battery needs replacing.  2 stars because it's a nice looking watch.  Don't feel like trying to go through the trouble of returning so I will see if I can  replace battery myself.,2,213
"Set seemed to be of good quality when we received  it, but the underwear shrunk significantly after washing.  Did not seem to help keep my son warm.",2,148
Cute bra but so not for high impact running and crossfit. Tons of side boob.,2,76
"So we ordered a 4T two pack, one set was 4T but the other was a mislabeled 3T? Not even sure how this happens. The quality between the 2 sets also differs. The 4T is soft whereas the smaller set is course? Not loving these thermals",2,231
"the material is thinner than I expected, I don't like it when you can see the toes through the socks.",2,101
If you are allergic to metals avoid these,2,41
These are very nice quality skirts and would be great if they were sized anything close to the description.  My 3X size skirts will only fit maybe a sized 16-18 ladies.  Hugely disappointing!,2,191
"Very nice looking dress, but the zipper broke before I could even try it on.  The dress is also pretty short, which I actually consider a good thing.  I am 5 feet tall and if I wasn't returning the dress because of the zipper, I wouldn't have had to shorten it, which is rare.",2,276
"I saw lots of reviews says this fit short.  I did not find that to be the case.  It was definitely long in the rear and just overall big.  The material was so-so, more of a slippery poly than chiffon w/ a slight sheen.  For reference I am 5'6"", 130lbs and 32B, I had ordered a small.",2,283
it fit but the bottom part is not cute!!!! idk what they were thinking,2,70
The slit is bigger than expected,2,32
I had to return it because of the size was too small,2,52
Rolls great. One trip to Dallas and one of the foot pieces is missing with a sharp screw sticking out!  So disappointed!!,2,121
The torso is too long.,2,22
Jewel fell off after I wore it two times...,2,43
"I got these scissors for one reason: to safely cut bandages and gauze used for dressing of wounds and cuts. After using them for the first time, I can report that the blades are so dull that they couldn't cut through cotton gauze protecting a knee abrasion. Totally useless.",2,274
Good for a costume. Not good for anything else,2,46
Very thin and doesn’t stay up over your mouth,2,45
"While this dress is very pretty, the material is very thin & would require a full slip.",2,87
Bought in large and skirt was good but the square that has the strap thing is not made bigger for bigger sizes the model is prolly a small so it works for her but if you a large or bigger don’t waist your money material was kind itchy as well,2,242
The beads are dyed and they get on your skin,2,44
"I love the look of the bag, but i can honestly say that the bad smell is not going away...and i tried a lot! I own this bag now over a year and its still smells bad. Would not buy it again.",2,189
Fits nothing like the model. It's very good material but if you want it to fit loose then buy 2 larger sizes.,2,109
"They are super cute but, they broke less than 24 hours of getting them 😢😢",2,73
"Pretty, but strap broke the first day I used it.",2,48
"Fits weird and it's just one layer of flat lace, I could've made this myself",2,76
Cheaply made my strap broke while I was on vacation. Was the second time wearing it. I had to throw it away. It is more of a pink color than a peach coral color,2,160
I thought this was an earring cuff for the middle of the ear...good quality and fast delivery.,2,94
"It looks pretty cheap and is also too small for a regular head. Made for kids, or something... not worth it!",2,108
They keep you very very warm,2,28
"Material is really nice and soft, but my shirt came with several oil stains on it. I have washed it several times, without drying it and I have treated it, but the stains are set. I like the shirt, it looks and feels great. But that is a huge disappointment.",2,258
"BUT even then, I feel like these are definitely CENTS worth to make and put together. Clearly crudely made. Would've returned, but they fell off easily and with no indications from how light and papery they are.",2,211
Very thin and did not hit in my waist like picture shows..,2,58
I work in a chicken plant was to thin for me to wear tho,2,56
"It does not look like the picture. The quality was very flimsy, the top was not stretched to hold the lace and the bottom was longer and loser than expected.",2,157
I wanted to have some of the USA Gymnastics performances to motivate my 3 years old who is now taking gymnastics classes.<br />In the whole DVD there are maybe 3-5 minutes of the USA gymnastics. Not worth it for the price.,2,222
Lights doesnt work.,2,19
Bought the shoes end of Sept. 2018 and they were as advertised until the insides began to cut into my feet after 4 months  of daily use. I had to buy Dr. Scholl's plantar fasciitis inserts to wear them again.,2,208
I like the length if the socks as the came over the calf.  There was little to no compression in the foot and ankle area.  Not what I was looking for so I returned them.,2,169
"Too flat,",2,9
This was not made of metal.  It was like a painted plastic much like you'd see on a toy.  I requested a return and at least was refunded.  If you don't mind wearing plastic... then by all means forge ahead lol.  I gave two stars simply because I was readily refunded.,2,267
"So disappointed, this dress does not look like it appears I will be wearing it around the house or maybe a grocery store run.",2,125
The owl is huge,2,15
"Such a cute idea, but it is of poor quality material. The bottom puffs out from the top at an unflattering angle and the bottom looks like mosquito netting.",2,156
I did not like the attachment band. I liked the size of them but did not feel like the quality was there. I returned them for another pair from a different company.,2,164
"Not what I expected at all, looked like a cheap cut up t shirt, I’m not even using it like I thought I would.",2,109
"AS other purchasers said, looks much worse than the original ad. The current picture is correct; but is not the photo (different mask) that was pictured when I and many others bough it.",2,185
"This shirt is TINY! The shirt is beautiful, but there is no way anyone over 100lbs could wear a medium. The fabric has zero give. I am super disappointed because I really do love the shirt, but I don't think I could even fit in a 2x with how off the sizing is.",2,260
dont like for my needs,2,22
This dress is a super cheap product and doesn't look picture.,2,61
El estilo es muy diferente ala de la foto,2,41
I bought this for my fifteen year old grand daughter who loves dragons. She does not wear it. She told me it is too hard to put on.,2,131
"They look nice and the material is ok, but length and waist size are off for me.",2,80
"It was very light and the color was nice, but I just didn't like the look of it.  I don't know why...",2,101
These were huge!,2,16
Didn’t look like the picture look very cheap going to use them as house shoes,2,77
The strap is not long enuf to go across the body and it's a little to small for my checkbook wallet,2,99
Works ok,2,8
Shoe Is already torn up. Wore first on June 5th and it's now Aug 3rd.  Shoe has been torn up for 3 weeks now,2,108
This was a very nice skirt with perfect fit but it really smell bad. I took it out and tried to air it out maybe because of the material but it did work out. It stunk really bad.,2,178
"Not only did these fit too small, but when I tried to at least move around in them I felt like someone would have a hard time bending or kneeling in them. Would not buy if you plan on doing any type of work requiring any of those or even simply tying your shoe.",2,261
Big in the shoulders and not fit as expected,2,44
"For reference I am 5'6, 160 pounds and wear a 40DD bra size. The top fit well everywhere besides the built in bra. The top was way to small and I ordered the largest size I could find. The bottoms were of course the largest size, so they fit too baggy. I returned this piece.",2,275
sent back runs way small!,2,25
Bought xlarge as I bought it before and it fits... now it seems as if it is 2x. Not pleased.,2,92
Had it 2 months and it’s completely broken down. They bottoms all ripped off and the toe section wore through.,2,110
"It was a really cute purse but the handles started fraying and falling apart within a month of having it. Too bad, the rest of it is really nice.",2,145
"These are pretty large for children's gloves. They might fit a 14 year old girl but they are not close to the right size for my 10 year old girl.<br /><br />Also, they had dirty fingers when they came. They have definitely been used before I received them.",2,256
Unable to straighten the wire in the rim,2,40
"I liked the style of these socks and the skid protection  is good but when I put them on, they felt like the heel is in the wrong place so they're tight and uncomfortable around my ankle.  Disappointing.",2,203
They run a little small. Especially if you lift weights in them then your nipple is exposed.,2,92
"Returned, colors are attractive and cheerful however, I expected socks to be thicker and cushioned they are thin.",2,113
"Came broken.  Otherwise, pretty.  fairly sad because i wanted them for my wedding.",2,82
"Cute dress and concept--and great Kelly Green color, but the top collar sits back too far making the neckline look big and awkward. Don't do it.",2,144
Would not fit the 4010 Trans,2,28
"Completely see through, and very thin material.",2,47
"Looks too fake.  Nice watch but couldn't really pass as gold.  Color is too bright. Beside my solid gold ring, it looks like a neon color",2,137
"I usually wear Size L, but these fit like a small...way too small...didn't fit at all above my knees!!",2,102
Terrible fabric - not soft and wrinkles horribly. Will not repeat.,2,66
Way to narrow for me. If you have a narrow foot you will be okay. They seem to be made really well.,2,99
"This looked awesome online, However the material is so strange and wrinkles badly.  I haven't worn it yet.",2,106
"Warm and good looking, but after only a few uses started losing stitching. Also, too much air gets in thumbs even when texting flaps closed.",2,140
The opening to slip the foot into the slipper is way too small.  Have to push and push to get a foot through.,2,109
Bought these for a boyfriend and they barely lasted a day. the clasp broke almost immediately,2,93
"Cute, size up twice. I’m a 10/12 and the XL was still too small. Wish it fit.",2,77
I ordered this but only got one.  Still very cute but kind of a let down.,2,73
Very poorly stitched. Sleeves way too big. Color was not like the picture.,2,74
the pieces are nice but the seller did not provide a EGL Certificate  like he promised,2,86
Waistline has no give.  Wish they came in size 18 or at least have the adjustable band inside.,2,94
"The picture is very misleading. The skirt looks almost twice as long in the picture, than it actually is.",2,105
"Tore at wrist.  :(<br /><br />Flexible, comfortable.",2,52
"did not care for the material, it rolls",2,39
They like to slide up on my waist which becomes very uncomfortable. They don’t look flattering either.  Not cute,2,112
Kept opening & fitbit kept falling out.  I had to quit using it for fear of losing my fitbit.  Chain tangled & knotted & couldn't get the knot out.,2,147
Not soft. Too thick. Too small.,2,31
"Cute robe, bad planning. I could tell that the red would bleed in the wash so I washed it separately. Good thing I did it bleed into the white arms and bunny ears. Now they are pink.",2,182
"Wouldn't purchase again, neck has wrinkles, very cheap looking.",2,63
"Fit was fine, but very poorly made. The hat material where it is sewn into the flexfit band is all bunched up and wrinkly, even when wearing it. Does not seem like a genuine FlexFit hat, at least like none of the 10 others i’ve owned. Returning and buying direct from Nixon.",2,274
The soles are a different color green . In the advertising pic it shows them as the whole show being one color,2,110
"I really wanted to like this shirt, but it’s oddly made. It was tight getting over my head then seemed to fit, but once I raised my arms the shirt lifted up to my chest. There’s an odd material lining the shirt, making it tight and causing lifting.",2,248
"I’m 5ft 4, and high waisted. The tie of the robe is near my chest, way too high and attached. Sized very small.",2,111
It’s cute but I returned it because it was see through,2,54
These were too big for my 6 year old. They also came open easily. Lost one the second day. :/,2,93
"Very cheap material, it's more of a swimsuit cover up. Than a dress",2,67
Band fits poorly tool for removing is very flimsy huge gap between band and watch very disappointed with this product,2,117
The mask is good quality but only one size and it’s really big,2,62
Ordered XL but fits more like a small so unwearable for me,2,58
The fabric was a little too see through for me to wear. There was no tummy control to speak of. In fact you could see my belly button and everything! The back went up a little higher than expect as well.,2,203
"Shacket fit is nice, however the fabric quality is quite cheap and the button down lining is as well. Not a good or soft quality waffle knit, it is pretty rigid and scratchy.",2,174
Ridiculously short and very cheap. You have to attach buckles yourself. Returned.,2,81
These pants run very small,2,26
The material was cheap! It looked nothing like the picture,2,58
"Does not fit like anything I was expecting, picture shows the side opening just under the bra, mine is pretty much at my waist.",2,127
Very cheap material.,2,20
Cheaply made but cute . Just make sure to cover in clear nail polish or elae its sure to make ur fingers freen also they are a bit small,2,136
I don’t see how these can be unisex.  This fits tighter than expected so I don’t see how they would ever fit a man.,2,115
Too small.<br />Not true measures 14 * 11 * 6 which says it.<br />I did not return it proque I live in Dominican Republic and chaos mail.,2,137
There are threads that were as long as the scarf unraveling. ☹,2,62
Very thin. Have to wear a shirt under it,2,40
A bit too small for a large and the length is too short.  Picture shows full length to ground.,2,94
"The jellyfish they sent me is yellow, not white but with the color lights it is hard to see what color the jellyfish is.",2,120
disappointed that it was already tarnished when I received it!,2,62
They were not quite as silky smooth as I had hoped for,2,54
"shirt material is nice, but it's too small for my 3 yr old even though i ordered a 4T, and the shorts seem to fit fine but material is cheap, don't think they're going to survive after 2-3 washes.",2,196
"The bra seems like it we would work. The bra is heavy so when sticking its a bit awkward and heavy. It doesn't seem to stick upwards but almost drags down, feeling heavy.",2,170
"The section of the dress at the waist looks terrible and the shoulder part is way to big to fit comfortably, Generally I can make things work that don't fit but this is just nothing like the picture.",2,199
"It’s a fine cheap watch band. I wore mine to work for about a month or two before the clasp broke, you get what you pay for.",2,124
Loved it but didnt fit its way too small,2,40
Cute bracelets but they are NOT yellow.  They’re at best a yellowish cream color. Very disappointed,2,99
Not what I expected but will be ok for what I need it for.,2,58
Fell apart within a month...,2,28
Fit is way too tight.  Lovely socks just don't fit.  Not everybody has beanpole legs.,2,85
I didn't like the clinginess of the material - accentuates  my back rolls.,2,74
"They fit good, when they are off the zipper is a little hard to zip sometimes",2,77
cheap and the color was awful!!! wasted 14.99,2,45
The arms are tight and I’m afraid if I order the next size up the shrug will hang funny...,2,90
The earrings themselves are fine but they arrived without any backs so now I have to go out and see if I can buy backs to fit the earring. Very disappointing,2,157
"The model looks way cuter than I did. I was OK, not great. the material also isn't that great.",2,94
"Not the color I ordered but kept anyway because my son liked it, jacket is nice but be careful when ordering I ordered white/navy and got white/navy/red as seen in default picture.",2,180
Just know that their idea of taffeta feels just like the material a tent is made of.,2,84
I've gotten free tshirts softer than this one. The material is very scratchy. I got a medium and normally wear a medium and believe this item to be true to size. The print is cute but looks smaller and higher up in the example photo. I am returning it.,2,252
"My husband had another pair of these shorts that he loved, same size, brand and style.  These shorts arrived and seemed to be made of a different fabric and the fit was off, very tight in the rear and leg area.",2,210
They're flimsy plastic and don't grip well. I wouldn't buy them again or recommend them to anyone who wants to buy a decent pair of shades.,2,139
"Necklace snapped almost immediately.  The charm was cute, but I’ll need to get a new chain.",2,91
"It's a kind of smaller sized comparing to most other brands, but the quality is good. I am going to keep it and try to wear it.",2,127
Too much fringe.,2,16
cute dress runs really large though,2,35
returned it,2,11
i fell in love with this anklet but it broke apart the first day. very unhappy about it.,2,88
"Very disappointed<br />Color is pumpkin, orange<br />There is absolutely no red in it<br />Was going to wear it for July 4 but would look quite preposterous with a blue and white jacket",2,185
Cute but chain broke 3rd time wearing it,2,40
The photos are showing a fully puffed cropped vest. Instead I received a vest inside a vacuumed sealed bag. I took the vest out and let it sit for 2 days thinking it would fully puff but nope. It's still flat.,2,209
Looks very plastic-y.  Nice design but couldn't get past the material.,2,70
"trust me, you can't wear this outside, this is to wear under a long see through dress. I kept it anyways and wore around the house once. don't think it is worth it",2,163
Barely fit my 8 year old granddaughter’s head.,2,46
"I loved this too until I washed it, and it pulled terribly. I'm very disappointed because it's so cute and comfortable with leggings. I ordered the wine color, and color is nice. It fits true to size.",2,200
I think it runs a bit big .... material is ok but a bit on the thin side. If you dont have curves this dress just kind of hangs on you,2,134
It's just OK - Pendant looks cheap and black leather cord is very stiff.  Not gift quality,2,90
Looks nice but it didn't last long. The slides crack after 2 drops.,2,67
"Velcro ripped off after 33 days; return window is 31 days. I feel like I’m an anomaly since i haven’t seen anyone else with this issue. But still sucks. It’s a $30 kid’s shoe. Should have lasted at least a few months, i would think. Maybe they were just extra loved, haha!",2,272
"nice color.<br />It feels too small in the tip of the toes, but still slips out from the foot while walking. I will try to buy ankle padding.",2,141
"Uneven seams, threads hanging out. The shirt looked years old after one wash and rolled up everywhere out was sewn poorly.  Looks like it was purchased from a 1st time 7th grade home ec class.  I'm pretty much over the cheapy clothes.  JCP clothes hop on to other kids, this is wash & toss.",2,290
"The description said thick socks but they are really thin, not good for the cold weather.",2,89
Flimsy material.,2,16
Too small sadly,2,15
Size does not match the size chart.,2,35
"First,I ordered a small and received a medium.  So, the shirt is too large.  It is also dingy looking and not white as shown in picture.  The shirt I received and this picture do NOT appear to be the same shirt.",2,211
It's beautiful but came broken. Not worth the hassle to return. Just gonna accept the loss.,2,91
the dye is wearing off quickly on the canvas and the inside structure isn't user friendly....inside pockets collapse into bag when you put items in it☹️<br />but as a backpack style it is fine,2,192
"When I  saw this earrings. I  couldn't  wait to get it and when I  got it, it was nothing  like the picture. I was disappointed.",2,128
So disappointed as it was too small for my ear.  Nice buy for the price but not sure how to measure to be sure it fits.,2,119
Too hot against skin,2,20
"Size was much too big, but nice material",2,40
"The elastic in the waistband is not secure. After the first wash, it turn around and is no longer flat... not well made...",2,122
Put the shirt on once and it has a huge hole in it !!!,2,54
It was cute but broke after 2 weeks,2,35
"I’m tall and have a chest, and this was way too big in the chest area.<br />Had to return",2,89
Product looked promising but became sort of unusable just after 2-3 uses as it would not seal around eyes and thus would fill up with water.,2,140
The fabric is so horrible,2,25
"This shirt was just big from the neck, wide that it would show shoulders lol, but overall my son loved it and wore it to Hollywood Studios.",2,139
Los botones están flojos y hacen mucho ruido al caminar o al moverse,2,68
"The purse is not lined, there are no pockets, everything lumps into the center! Leather is nice , color decent however a rough unpolished leather bag!! Save your money!!",2,169
"I really wanted to like these dresses, but I just thought they looked cheap. I was hoping they would be as good of quality as an incline wrap dress, but I was disappointed. I sent all three dresses back.",2,203
2 out of the 3 watches had broken clasps on arrival.,2,52
The top is beautiful but it's really small. I wear 1X purchased XXL and it fits perfect  my granddaughter who wears a medium top??? So disappointed.,2,148
"Fabric is extremely thin and cheap. Pictures are deceiving. I doubt it would last more than a few washes. Pattern is great, just cheaply made.",2,142
Very cheaply made,2,17
The shirt collar (blue and grey one) was super wide... why ship it like that? for a couple of dollars..smh .. the other one was fine,2,132
"These are cute bracelets and you can't beat the price, but I only wore it a couple times and one of the ropes broke off one side of the clasp so I ended up throwing it away.",2,173
The dress was very large for a size small,2,41
Odd cut to this shirt.  Neck too wide at same time shoulder seams were tight and fit too small. Didn't end up liking the Pink print in person either. Returned as it just didn't fit.,2,181
"Ehh a little on the cheap side I thought they would be more structured and conforming.  I use they<br /> Under my work shirt (I work in a resturant) to give me a second layer.  They are ok for the job I am using them for, just not totally what I expected.",2,255
"I’m sorry but this sweater is very cheap looking and feeling.  Too bad, I was excited to get it.",2,96
Very tiny for a 3XL. More like a small/medium.,2,46
These are not tiny. But are small however.. they won't stay up. I would have to tell you that you can not expect to do be able to do ANY activity wearing these. Especially not swim. I feel ripped off.,2,200
Pretty but awkward to put on and a little too big for my taste.,2,63
I sent this hat back. Looks better in pictures.,2,47
"I was looking for orange stone earrings and found these.  However, when they arrived they were yellow rather than orange, not at all what I was expecting.  The earrings themselves are nice, but not what I wanted.  Had no problem returning them and got a full refund.",2,266
"I brought a small but should have gotten a medium , the sizes run really small , like a size smaller",2,100
"Way, way, WAY too small, short and skimpy for anything claiming to be PLUS sized. Disappointing. Wanted for Hawaii vacation. Returning.",2,135
Strong mold musty smell. Cute design and fit. Very see through.,2,63
Top is beautiful but would have rather had full bottom instead of thong,2,71
Inexpensive appearance.  Not worth the money,2,44
They roll down. These undies do not stay up and therefore has no tummy control. They fit perfectly though and they quality is good.,2,131
Buttons fell off two minutes into wearing it!,2,45
It's see through. I can see my bra through it,2,45
was a lots of ones that didn't worked.,2,38
The shirt was super cute but after you wash it the seams started to unravel. Also there’s no buttons in the crotch so you have to take the whole shirt off to change their diaper.,2,178
Fabric very thin much thinner than I anticipated and it was way too small. Lovely style but fabric and attention to size dimensions don’t coincide.,2,147
Looked great but fell apart within 2 weeks.,2,43
This item was returned.  It was cheaply made and the watch would not keep time.,2,79
"Smaller cut and fit I’m a large but ordered an extra large because it looked a little bit like a junior size.<br /><br />Also, top has a stain.",2,143
"I ordered a 2-pack of six/each.  6-white & 6-black.  I washed them before wearing, the black socks shrunk by 20%, they are now much smaller than the white sox.",2,159
Not a good quality. The package was poor and broken. The tip of the umbrella was fully exposed.,2,95
"I washed this dress in cold water and hung to dry and I would say that it shrunk about 3” in width and now it doesn’t fit.  So sad, such a cute dress.",2,150
"The cardigan was nice and it fit well. However, it was not a true white like the photo shows so I returned it.",2,110
It's ok.,2,8
"I wore a pair of the protectors on my high heels for my daughter's outside wedding, however by the end of the day, my heals wore through the protector!  Still trying to get them off my shoes!  Would never buy this product again.",2,228
"I love this, but the chain broke the second day my daughter wore it.",2,68
"color is baby pink. ugly baby pink, does not look like picture",2,62
Cut way too low,2,15
No es bueno por el precio!,2,26
"Bad fit. Too thick. Hard to put on and take  off. Bad construction, makes it hard to sit down.",2,94
"These were not very compression-like on my 12 year old daughter. They were very wide so they didn't ""hug"" the skin. It was also very frustrating that they are PRIME eligible; yet, the company will not accept a return. I guess they know their product fits weird.",2,261
"This bag does not look like the picture!! It's MUCH more orange in color and is not as big as they make it seem. Also, my bag came with a horrendous odor coming from it... so bad that I was able to smell it even before taking it out of the package.",2,248
could not use it because it looked like my toddler's head was being crushed. returned it.,2,89
I loved these pants when I first put them on.  Comfortable and great for work.  Followed the directions for washing and drying them but they shrunk.  Now they are about 2 inches shorter than they were.  I now have cropped pants.  Disappointed.,2,243
[[VIDEOID:57950a0fcedd243c5e2561ec6e732981]] se puso verde de plata no tirne nada,2,81
"Consistency of sand paper and smaller than expected.  Returned right away.  Even at the lightning deal price they werent worth wearing,  maybe just not my style",2,160
i ordered a large and the shirt fits like a small way to big of a difference between sizes...  pick something way bigger then you normal size,2,141
"Shoulder holes are pretty big, kinda awkward, neckline is high up looking funny.  I've learned this week not to buy clothes on-line<br />*UPDATE * started to unravel after 1st wash",2,180
"Very pretty color and style but, waaay to short. Too small over all. Would've probably needed to get 2 sizes bigger for it to fit properly.",2,139
Strings are very short - very thin slick material. Not as expected. More like child size than adult . Disappointed,2,114
Product is not adult size. Quality and coloring is cute but my 9 year old is still in children’s sizes and couldn’t wear them so there is no way they work for an adult woman,2,173
"It is too short for my big melon, and really hard to get over the earpieces on my wayfarer style glasses. J-E-T-S  Jets- Jets- Jets !!",2,134
The gold tone wore off within 2 weeks.,2,38
2XL fits like a Large,2,21
"It seems like a quality product but it is poorly size, very tight and short even I bought larger size than I usually ware.",2,122
"I wouldn't consider these to be ""compression"" type tanks. They ride up very easily, they have zero compression to them. The material does wick though.",2,150
I really like the Damascus but the handle leaves a lot to be desired and the sheath is very cheap,2,97
"At first I thought it was pretty good, even though the card slots are pretty tight and I'm afraid I might tear one, but then I realized that the charger won't stay in while the case is on. They space for the charger to plug in is too small. If this wasn't so cheap, I'd probably ask for a refund.",2,296
Over all very comfortable pants 👖,2,33
Eh. Not the best quality.  Could have made one for cheaper than I paid for this but just didn’t have the time to make my own.  It served its purpose but price doesn’t match quality,2,180
Rotos,2,5
You get what you pay for.  This is poorly made and something you cannot wear often because of the poor quality.,2,111
Seemed cheap. Too large for gym bag...like a piece of luggage,2,61
Does not fit as expected and they have no bigger sizes,2,54
"They are not for me, they could be better.. I really don't like the plastic back pieces.. They get weak after a while and do fall out. Plus the rhinestones are small so they go thru the hole. I have a normal size piecing, and they go thru.",2,239
I wish I could say I liked it but unfortunately the belt broke the 1st time it was put on. I may try another product your customer service is very good,2,151
Sole came apart after first wear,2,32
Cloth not what I expected. Dress too small,2,42
"The glasses have magnification, so it's hard to see and focus in objects.",2,73
"Dress super cute!!  However, really for a younger person as it was incredibly revealing at the busy.  Loved the little stomach cut out but was just to lie cut for me.  I should have really looked at the title but went off of the picture of the model",2,249
Watched it seperately in cold water the first time and the red bled all over the white.,2,87
Crotch area hem unraveled after wearing it once. I was pretty disappointed because I loved these otherwise.,2,107
Waited 35 days for these items to be delivered. Quality was so -so. Grade C .,2,77
"The description says it came in a velvet bag....it did not. The picture shows what I received as my order. The keychain is cute, dont get me wrong....but not $15.00 cute. It would of been nice, and at least somewhat worth the money, if it was a better quality keychain.",2,269
"The shorts fit great. A little sheer, but I would’ve made it work. My issue was that the neckline looked nothing like what was advertised. I’m typically a small and got a medium hoping it would be a little more loose.",2,217
cute but top keeps going up on the back because the back have any type of closure.,2,82
pretty but arms way too small,2,29
These are cute and exactly what I was looking for IF they didn’t come unscrewed so easily!! I’ve lost 2 balls within 3 days!!,2,125
I bought an extra large thinking I could definitely wear it but nope it did feel comfortable when I was trying it on,2,116
"It’s kind of see though and I wouldn’t have cared that much but it just fits weird. The bottom part sits in the middle of my boobs so it looks short or something. I don’t know, just very strange fit",2,198
This one is not polarized. Disappointed. I bought three others glasses 2 brown and 1 black and they all polarized,2,113
Pretty dress but the white was way too seethrough.,2,50
Pretty but who buys a watch that doesn't work? How frustrating! I don't have a readily available watch fixer so that proves to be a significant inconvenience. When I purchase a new watch I expect it to work at least initially! And it was too complicated to change myself with a watch kit.,2,288
"This item is much smaller than I had imagined and the shipping was so high that I won't return it.  $8 shipping for a $13 t shirt.  It is also not long as described, just a regular shirt length. I ordered with a bunch of other items and was told it is free shipping so all around, no pleased.",2,292
"I'm usually a size S, but bought a M to make sure. Turned out they were too small, so returning.",2,96
"Not the best quality dress, it should be half the cost. Ordered a medium and the chest area was just odd. And the line in the center of the dress made the entire dress unflattering. Unfortunately sending back.",2,209
"Not for me. The model looks great wearing it so I figured I'd give it a shot, but the hat is super loose on top and looks horrible! I could not wear it out I the house. It is warm and looks like a good quality, but just a horrible fit.",2,235
"Looks nice, quality seems okish but chrono hands will not reset to zero..  sending back",2,87
Not even 5 days and they started changing color already.,2,56
Have a lot of XXL shirts and this is much smaller than any I have.,2,66
Cute ring in photos but you can't see the writing ans the stones are almost microscopic. Not worth the money. The images on this are extremely inaccurate.,2,154
This product some-what resembles bacon but it's a little too red which makes it not look that realistic.,2,104
"I was super saddened when I opened this package. I sized up and everything and the skirt was still incredibly small! It looked just as pictured in the picture so I had high hopes till it came time for trying it on. Oh well, guess I’ll give it as a gift.",2,253
"Does not fit my glasses, might be OK if it did. All these Solar Shield clip-on lenses appear only to fir smaller frames. Sizing guidance at the site are not useful in selecting lens.",2,182
It’s like wearing a ski mask and not pulling it down on your face.<br />It needs to be much shorter,2,99
I really loved it wen I received it but when wearing it for a few minutes the chains get tangled right away....,2,111
"It took me 30 minutes to close this earring, even once I flipped it around and closed it backwards. I measured these and they are 6mm, not 10mm. The earring is fine once on, but I wanted something that is actually 10 mm.",2,220
"Wear XL bought 2xl snug,bought other companies,no problem",2,57
"Belt was beautiful at first, but the stones fell off way too easy! I would not buy this again",2,93
"Dress has a tube top, if you will, built in and does not stay up on its own. We tried pinning/stitching it up but the material isn’t wide enough to cover cleavage.",2,163
"I was pretty disappointed with the length of the leggings. I'm 5'7"" and these are like high waters on me. I guess they'll have to be pajama pants.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />If you would like to keep them soft on the inside, never ever, EVER wash them.<br />One wash and now they are itchy and rough!",2,300
Shrunk after 1 wash. :(,2,23
"Very see-through and the material felt very cheap, almost like a costume. The dress itself is very cute (from afar) and fit well, but I couldn't get past the material.",2,167
nothing about this shirt is &#34;black&#34; and the material is very thin and it runs small in sizing.  a 2x fit like a L and was to tight to look cut and flowy like the picture.,2,178
"Did not expect the size to fit that big, was disappointed, but sold it to a friend.  Will not order swim suites on line any more will go to store and try on.",2,157
"Poor quality trucker hat,  with loose stitching.",2,48
"Fit fine,  but holes in the knit material right out of the package....",2,70
Loose by my stomach have to tie another knot for it to look normal.,2,67
It was actually a plus sized dress and slightly frumpy looking. Maybe because I’m only 5’1” it went below my knees and looked odd.,2,130
"I really loved the color of this bag in the listing, but it was so much darker than that. So disappointed.",2,106
Broke second time using.,2,24
It's too large and lacks shape.,2,31
"Not all the lights came on, the package was damaged, came a day before the party so we had to use what we could.",2,112
"Shirt is cute but I usually find M to sometimes be too large but this M was very very tight.  If you don't want a skin tight fit, size up.  Had to return",2,153
The medium is more like a small. It’s a little see through but altogether it’s an okay look.,2,92
This pattern in particular will make you look like you have permanent camel toe- great fabric and sizing just not a fan of this pattern,2,135
"Great looking pair of boots, my only negative is they arnt as “wide” calved as promised.",2,88
Item arrived as promised. It has a bad odor to it. Washed it once but the smell is stil slightly there. It is not slouchy as pictured. Looks more like a blazer and the armpit area is a little snuggly like someone else had mentioned.,2,232
"I was impatient to receive it, but what I got was too tight, returned it as I have received it. Although I have a prime membership, but I had to pay for the return postage, they might reimburse me later for it. The only thing I like about it is the hat band.",2,258
"I have chunky thighs, not huge thighs, but they are chunky.  I ordered these and they are just like the knee high tights you buy at any store, they were way too tight and didn't seem like they would stay up.  Returning item.",2,224
it was too small,2,16
"They’re so cute and small. However, they ripped so fast. ☹️",2,59
I was thinking this would be more tee shirt material and it was silky and stretchy. Too tight for my 16/18 size in plus.,2,120
They seem to work as advertised. I've had them only 24 hours. They came after 13 days. I was not told there would be any delay.,2,127
They feel great but my puppy got thru the thumb in a minute or so,2,65
Ouch!! Very painful!  I could only wear it for a few hours.,2,59
I would go up a size or 2 . extremely small . i wear a size 14 and i bought an xlarge ..way too small,2,101
"This jogger run big, I’m 5,3 and 115pounds order small, they came baggy, had to return them. Color and dye tie came cute.",2,121
"I ordered a Large and while the body fit pretty well, the lined, underwire cups were comparable to an A size cup.  It was also a bit short in the torso.  Delivery was fast and return simple and easy.",2,199
"For a North Face product, I expected better. It was thin. I found a cheaper product with a thick fleece lining and better stretch. This is not worth the money",2,158
"I like the design ,but it's somewhere between European and US sizing...made in China. ( not Chinese sizing cuz I would never fit. Ots just slightly small for me but I'm admittedly overweight now. I'll diet cuz I like it lol",2,223
"Super cute at first, but within a few days of wear it broke off and became discolored! The gold is more of a true gold rather than a soft yellow gold! Cute but quality isn’t really there!",2,187
eh not very flattering.  Its looks better in the pictures.,2,58
Too cheap,2,9
I don’t like the spandex material. Other than that it’s an ok dress,2,67
Humm,2,4
I bought XL. I didn't know they were EU XL and US L do they are far too small! The fabric is nice and stretchy but I had to give them to my daughter.,2,149
Comfy but gets holes very easily.,2,33
Fell apart after the second day.,2,32
"They were just too big for me. Cute, though!",2,44
"Nice shirt, but it is NOT an extra large as stated in the description at the time I purchased it. It was intended to be worn by my husband for an ugly sweater party, but I ended up giving it to our 17-yr-old son who wears a medium in sweatshirts. It fit perfectly on our son.",2,275
"The gloves are uncomfortably tight and the seams inside are too rough. I have small hands to begin with, but these gloves are child-sized. Several of the fingers came frayed and would likely unravel completely if I were to continue wearing them. Very cheaply made.",2,264
"I was excited to see how many onesies I was getting for the price but, unfortunately when we washed these they shrank significantly. I am talking they went from 3-6 months to 0-3... The prints we're super cute but, because they shrank we ended up giving them to someone else with a newborn.",2,290
The material is kinda cheap and see through. They're smaller than expected and wouldn't buy them again.,2,103
"The material and buttons are kind of cheap, and the white is too white.  Closet hanger.  Not good enough to pair with my tuxedo.  Spend a few dollars more and buy a better one.",2,176
"This product came in a different color than ordered. Though a large, it fit snugger than the same large ordered separately. If you are looking for ""compression"" of significant amount, order a size smaller. Ankles are loose. Compression is mild at best. I ordered a Large for 5'9, 180, 34 inch waist.",2,299
Okay so I'm dropping to two stars from five because after wearing it a total of 10 times the band looks extremely worn and loose and the battery is going out already.,2,166
Never worked but looks cool . I found some ironic charm in the watch’s failure to track time.,2,93
Feels cheap and weird. Pockets dont lay down and look weird.,2,60
"The seam underbust made it drape strangely, and getting the tie to align over it never stayed for long. The slit is very high.",2,126
"Very soft and comfortable, however stretched out so quick, now so huge they drag the floor and arms fall off. I will try the size small and hope it works better.",2,161
"The magnets on these earrings are not strong enough to hold with any kind of physical activity.<br />Also, the setting of the jewel causes them to stick out away from your ear a bit, making them easier to be knocked off.",2,220
"I'm a little disappointed with the cardigan. The fabric is very thin, almost flimsy & the sweater doesn't fit right. I'm typically a size small but ordered a medium based on the reviews. The sweater is a good length but the arms are extremely tight. It is still wearable though just not a good fit.",2,298
The picture is nice BUT I hate the material. It's nylon and thick. I ordered a M but it looks more like a L.,2,108
"These did not stay up, they kept rolling down",2,45
Definitely smaller sizes. I bought 2 sizes too big and it was still too small,2,77
It’s made of cotton so it’s comfortable on the face but very thin layers (2 only). Need filter to be effective. The inside layer opens to one side so not easy to insert filter correctly.,2,186
Zipper broke. Too small.,2,24
The shoe was a little smaller than what I expect but was cute.,2,62
Worked. The glass shop won’t work on it they didn’t believe it’s titanium had to do it my self I guess for the price it’s ok,2,124
Cute but poorly made.,2,21
bought the same size as a previous rubber ring I had and it fit so tight that it was hurting. Plus the center carbon comes off and always gets soap and other stuff stuck underneath it. Look elsewhere.,2,200
for small stomachs. i got big muscle arms to show but want to hide big fat belly in process.  this shirt is for slim people.,2,124
"At first I was very pleased with the lenses and how dark they were but After two months of use and cleaning, the mirror coating has started to fade/peel away. I am really disappointed with the duration of the coating. I will have to find another set now.",2,254
Even tho it said 4× it was not. It was to small.,2,48
"El pedido llegó según lo solicitado pero sus tallas no cumple los estándares de tallas. Pedí talla L pero en el mercado latinoamericano es equivalente a una M, ojo al comprar no hay que confiar con lo que dice el vendedor y pedir tallas más grandes, al menos con este vendedor.",2,277
These gloves are pretty much impossible to put on a toddler’s hands. We finally gave up and bought a different pair. They ARE cute and seem to be well made. They just don’t fit well.,2,182
[[VIDEOID:b52c9621bcf74f6f3091e592055e06d5]] They're comfortable shoes and I'm a keep them cuz their house shoes but they're the wrong color,2,140
Had the wrong size label attached,2,33
Okay for price. Not wellput together. Disproportionate arms for the robe. They are extremely wide and very short. Not overly impressed and wouldn't purchase again.,2,163
"Don't spend the money, more work than it's worth and even then I am unsure I will actually be able to use. Hat comes very wrinkled and the wrinkles don't come out all together. Plus as pictured my product came damaged out of the box. High note, delivered as quoted.",2,265
The hats that caused me to order this were not in the box. And only 6 of 9,2,74
It don’t fit right for everybody it say x-large but I personally think it’s all the same size or weird sizing it’s cute. Have to find a creative way to wear it . Buy at your own risk.,2,183
It was way big. Different fabric than I expected.,2,49
"The over all look of these are ok, big problem is the backs will not stay on!!!! Look for something made a little better.",2,121
"Not cute:( super disappointed. Ordered a large but the sleeves are short, fits funny, and looks cheap.",2,102
Was a small size for my daughter ...,2,36
I felt these were too big and bulky. Not really what I expected.,2,64
Runs a lil small,2,16
"These barely qualify as t shirts.  Terrible quality.  I have always liked Hanes, these are different.  Incredibly thin.",2,119
"i returned this. i ordered the high waisted that had the rips in the front-cute pattern but they didn't fit well. cheeky shorts and the bag was big, i would have needed a belt since the back did not actually touch it was just loose.",2,232
"Very small, already has a rip in the seam for no reason. I'm not a wild person who rips my aprons... Anyway, I do like the pics on the aprons. They are cute, but I am dissapointed.",2,180
"[[VIDEOID:eb3303d0ce65ce0a1bfba0ef8441e32d]] So disappointed, was really excited for this top. Its beautiful and the fit is great if you don't lift your arms.<br />then its pulls it all out of shape.. Happens when reaching out too",2,230
"Very light fabric, cheap material, fits but has awkward measurements around the waist and bust. Would not recommend to anyone with larger boobs or bigger butt",2,158
Way to big. Looks really fake.,2,30
Pretty and could look nice but was received with a lot of tiny beads falling off.,2,81
Turned ugly tarnished color after wearing twice,2,47
So the material was a good quality but the sizing was way off. I ordered an xl and they barely fit a friend of mine who wears a med.,2,132
My bad I guess because I thought they would be stretchy and they’re not. The SUPER negative is that the seem on the zipper is already ripping. Ugh!,2,147
The shirt was really cute but that pants were cheap fabric and something I could done myself with a pair of Walmart pants.,2,122
The grey is clearly NOT grey.  It is purple.  Would have been fine if it had actually been the color as described.,2,114
Not light like picture verydark,2,31
"Great for the shower and/or wet environment, very comfortable, but believe it or not, this flip flop sheds!!..leaving little black pieces of rubber all over my tile floors 2 sweep up..didn't bother to return, won't buy again or recommend..",2,239
"To get the look in the photo, you'd have to fold in down and inside.  If it moves at all, it doesn't look like that.  Not printed correctly",2,139
"Very cheap looking, but will work for what It’s intended for.",2,61
I WOULD LIKE TO GET MY MONEY BACK AND RETURN THIS: this thing sheds lint like there's no tomorrow.,2,98
Flimsy and too short. Looks cheap,2,33
Poor.,2,5
"I like that shirt but the size is small in the shoulders, it feels like fat guy in a little coat !",2,98
"Might be good in a dry climate, but I bought it for a trip to Ireland.  It did not keep me dry in a steady light drizzle.  I ended up having to spend vacation money on a new one.",2,178
Disappointed that there isn't any text on the shirt I received.  It is completely washed out or misprinted.  I do love the Yorkie picture so it isn't a complete loss.,2,166
This sweater started unraveling after the first wear and had not even been washed yet.,2,86
not what I was looking for,2,26
Dress seem smaller in size than what I ordered. Seem more like petite. The dress is a nice dress but I would say it runs small. Returning.,2,138
too short side ways,2,19
"Excellent idea but not executed very well.  I ordered an XL because it said to go up one size.  With nothing in the wonderful storage pockets, I was uncomfortably tight in the jacket.  Only wore it once and gave it to Goodwill.",2,227
"Cheaply made, broke within weeks of purchasing the product. I would not recommend buying this product. Find something that looks like the will last longer and pay and extra buck or two.",2,185
Muy grande para ser small,2,25
Fits good but it has a hole in it,2,33
Not very attractive.  I won't wear it.,2,38
It's a bit see through and pretty loose. It kinda feels like I have to wear a shirt underneath it or a sweater on top of it when I work out.,2,140
Came missing the binocular tether and barely fit my Vortex Vulture HD 15x56.  I am a big guy 6”2” 290 and the straps barely fit around my chest.,2,144
The picture is deceiving. As the photo shows it looks like the stone is a prong setting when in fact it is not. Please change your photo so you're not advertising the wrong product.,2,181
Very disappointed with the quality the design on the front comes off first use,2,78
if you have more than a B cup this is NOT FOR YOU. I ordered an XL and didn't even cover half of my chest. I wear 36D. RETURNED.,2,128
Is nice is nothing to do with the picture or linen at all,2,57
"I'm confused by all the positive reviews. This might be the flimsiest mask bracket I've come across. It folds very easily under any pressure, and didn't do much to lift the mask off of my face. I would look elsewhere for a stiffer silicone version of this very design.",2,268
Real big.,2,9
You get what you pay for. Beads started coming loose right away and underneath the fabric was all of the stitches- they didn’t even add a backing which... I mean.. would help the beads from coming undone. Sent it back and honestly going to try and make something instead.,2,271
"Arms were way too tight - and I have relatively skinny arms. Also, the black strip in the center is just too long - looked very feminine. Too bad, 'cause the color is great (can't seem to find it anywhere else). Had to return.",2,226
"I knew it ran small, ordered a size up. My biggest issue was the red color transferred to my bed sheets.  I threw this thing in the trash and reordered a light color because it is rather cute!",2,192
The cut on the legs is too high up if you want for your boobs to sit in the cups and for bigger girls that just means the spillage at the bottom of the tummy area.. very awkward at the bottom but hey it pushes the girls up.,2,223
"Good steez, horrible quality. Have broken 2 of them in the last few months alone.",2,81
"The size was way off.  XL was more like a medium. It’s cute though.  I didn’t bother with a return, just donated it.",2,116
I had to take this and the other dress to my dress maker to alter for me. The material i dont like too much and in addition they are too short,2,142
in very disappointed. the glasses are crooked and I have to keep adjusting the edges to sit on my face. I'm gonna send them back,2,128
I had to return. It was too big for my taste.,2,45
cheap,2,5
"For some reason, I'' not buying that these earrings are stainless steel... I tried to wear them for a day, and my ears felt puffy and irritated. If you have allergies to metals, you might want to be careful using these. I'' not sure if I can ever wear these again.",2,264
Didn’t like the cheap fabric and the letters were all rolled up instead of laying flat. Looks like the will peel off with ease and washing.,2,139
NOT WIDE ENOUGH AT THE TOES,2,27
theyre wayyyyy bigger than expected.  the small is huge on me and theyre very stiff.  i have to wash and shrink them and hopefully theyll sofen up too  :/,2,154
"Love the idea. But...right out of the box one clip was already broken. Less than 24 hrs later, another has broken. No way the purse weighed anywhere near 8 lbs. Which the clip is said can hold.  Returning it would cost me almost as much as the purchase price..what to do?",2,271
"Very thin, and parts of the seem already had holes.",2,51
"Really not flattering for larger chest sizes. Feels matronly, think I need to give up the dream and get v neck cuts.",2,116
leather bad,2,11
"These earrings were cute, but very, very tiny.  Did not like them!",2,66
"This shirt is not flannel. It's a heavy twill, not soft but thick and stiff material. A good shirt if that is what you are looking for but not a soft flannel. Returned.",2,168
Too tight and too short,2,23
"It arrived with lots and lots of wrinkles. Even if I had ironed it or dry cleaned it, the front is pleated like a tuxedo shirt which I didn’t care for. I returned it the same day I received it.",2,193
Glasses were broken and hat is small - more a child size. The gloves were fine.,2,79
The shirt fit great except the arms were crazy big.....haven't worn it because of that.,2,87
Used it once and there was a big hole in the inside pocket. My things that were in the pocket fell into the lining of the bag. Very poorly made,2,143
The look is good but for an extra large it's a tight fit.,2,57
"My daughter is a huge Hermione Granger fan.  Great little packaged gift; come with red little satin bag. We gave this along with a Cruikshank's cat for Christmas. Unfortunately, it broke on her first time wearing.  She was so upset.",2,232
They don’t stick very well but looked cute enough to try.,2,57
Short seemed a bit small for me.  The graphic on the T seems a bit off center.  Fabric it self even after 3 washes still feels stiff and scratchy.  I would recommend a different shirt.,2,184
Order down,2,10
They look good but the part that goes between my toes felt horrible. I have many pairs of Reef flops that I love but not these.,2,127
"Not even close to the quality I expected. They smelled like petroleum and, after one wash, shriveled into faded wads I could barely get on my feet. Bummer.",2,155
unhappy but expecting to be so with AMAZON these days,2,53
"I do love the look of this ring, but it has already dropped a pearl and I've only had it 1 week.  Disappointed!",2,111
Too small.  Wallet won't fit inside it.,2,39
"It was as described, but cheap and gaudy to me.  I returned it.",2,63
"I received 2 bras, one was the correct size the other was 5 inches smaller.",2,75
Weird fabric!  Otherwise great product,2,38
Received it slightly broken. Link was unattached and hard to adjust back on -seems like it is not well made. The price point is okay for what you get.,2,150
"The hood doesn't not look like the one in the photo. The lining is not the fleece stated in the description, which was the main reason I chose this hoodie. The color is off. The hoodie itself is a nice but is not like the one in the photo. Will upload pic.",2,256
This item has an odd bunching in the cup area that I can’t get to flatten out.  Not loving this.,2,96
Great dress by the way it’s really sheer so if your wanting to have any other color underneath it will show,2,107
It is a beautiful watch band but it is far too bulky to wear. Its also very hard to adjust to make it tighter. Its a good watch band if your not planning on adjusting it but if you are it is too thick to move much.,2,214
Shoes are cute. Got a lot of compliments the first day but now one shoe lights up and the other no..so only cute for one day. I wish either both lit up or didn't,2,161
I did not like so i returned but it's well made.,2,48
"The card holder fell apart on me within about two months and detached itself from the lanyard, which sucked. But, the lanyard is really cute and I still use it, just with a different card holder that is much better!",2,215
Too big and came wayyy too late,2,31
"Very snug, stretchy thin fabric. Seems cheap. Not what I was expecting.",2,71
Shirt quality was normal but the ink/ washed away to 25% of it's original appearance after one wash. Losing 75% in a single wash is saddening but further it did so unevenly. Now it's just a shop rag.,2,199
It’s fits perfectly on a small wrist! But it broke in 3 days. I’m not very active throughout the day and it just broke and my watch fell. I’m glad I was at home and not in a public place because I would have lost my watch.,2,222
The bottom of bathing suit too big the length too short and the top too small,2,77
Soft but incredibly unflattering. The crotch area has excess fabric and looks like you either have saggy you know what or a male body part down there,2,149
The material is extremely cheap nothing like what i order online.,2,65
Much more pale color in person than as displayed in picture. False advertising. And the bag is much more affordable when purchased from original seller. But of course everyone has to make a profit.,2,197
Cute BUT will turn finger green in just days!,2,45
XXl is an odd material. Odd fit. I never wear it.,2,49
weirdest fit. I have big boobs yet it was still too big but the bottoms were small,2,82
"DOES NOT RELEASE THAT EASY ,",2,28
"No hold, definitely more cotton feel which I didn’t realize at first.",2,69
to late to send back,2,20
Smaller than shown on picture. Handle broke on the second use.,2,62
Does little for toe warmth<br />It fits over the shoe fine,2,58
"This “red” buffalo plaid dress is anything but red. It looks like a washed out rose color and faded black. It looks ten years old, not a fan. Missed the return window but wish I could give this back to the seller and ask why it looks so old.",2,241
"Quality is very poor, very thin not what I expected for sure not recommend",2,74
Tenía otra idea a lo q fue nada que ver con la foto es un hilito de anillo en la foto es mas ancho,2,98
Appears a little too ‘faux’ in person. Or maybe a little too plastic than faux leather! Color was also slightly off!,2,116
Very cheaply made. Stockings are extremely thin. Ended up not wearing them.,2,75
cheap!!,2,7
I love the look of these socks.... But found them too too tight...😒 ankles puffed up,2,84
"Size is accurate which is why 2 stars. Shipping was slow but mail time is slow now since covid. Poor quality, for it looks like something you would buy at dollar general.",2,170
Runs large and doesn’t lay right at neck.,2,41
"Too large and not satisfied with the material, rather cheap looking.",2,68
Very odd material.  Scratchy feeling on the inside.  Sleeves were way too short and the rest of the shirt was short and wide.,2,125
Very big. The chain was broken in the package.,2,46
"Way too small, fabric is thin.",2,30
I got a large and I should have gotten a medium. And I truley don’t know if this is a teal licensed Spider coat,2,111
"If you are a petite person with a small head, this hat is not for you.  Even though it says you can adjust it, it wasn't enough for me with a 20inch circumference. Lesson learned, best to buy hats at an actual store. Kmart had good ones and I ended up buying two there.",2,269
Not as solid or sturdy as I wanted. A bit flimsy on my 2yr old. Definetly temporary wear.,2,89
This bag was not comfortable on my shoulder and had much more 'bling' than was described.  I have returned it.  The shipping was on time and it seemed to be well made.  I may look for there types of handbags from this maker.,2,224
This is more like a children’s bracelet. It was much too tiny for me to wear but it is pretty.,2,94
I thought this has enough lights for both wheels and frame. The photo is extremely misleading. I also don't understand and it wasn't clear how you could put them on the wheel. The lights were bright and worked well and we were just able to wrap around the body frame of the bike.,2,279
"The shoes are simply gorgeous, but they run small, The fit across the front is for women with slim feet, not high instep.",2,121
Too thin material,2,17
"neckline is too deep, not appropriate for business",2,50
Dress fit perfect but retuning because of poor stiching near the end of the slit on the back and a brownish stain on the dress.,2,127
Too tight for me although the size medium usually fits my size 8 frame 150 pounds<br />Must return,2,98
"This is a fine looking bracelet, but unfortunately poorly crafted regarding all the sharp edges on the edge of every link.",2,122
Fits but not what I was expecting. Very thin and would melt if it got near a flame.,2,83
The shorts for perfect the shirt is a big small.,2,48
"It's not as thick as I was hoping for, but it's not bad. The design isn't as crisp on the hoodie as I thought it would and with it being thin, I feel like I've been jipped.<br /><br />It's a good buy for like 15 bucks, but not almost 30.",2,237
to wide. even with socks. length was right.,2,43
"Beautiful bag, however,  it's advertised  for a 15 in laptop and it does not easily  fit a 15&#34; laptop.  Will keep it as a bag, but will have to shop for the much needed fashion forward laptop bag.",2,200
Nice band for 10 months. Then it started to slip out of clasp.  I had to adjust it multiple times per day.  Finally added electrician's tape to make it thicker.,2,160
The glasses are good but as you can see the picture of the glasses i buy them cuse I dint have a purple glasses but went I got them they turn out to be blue!!!! It makes me think twice bfor i Oder from this company agine!!!!!,2,225
little eye pad came off,2,23
Really love the design but the material was transparent and cheap feeling. Would ALWAYS need to wear a full slip with it and that’s just not my jam....<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars for the design. If they had invested in non transparent fabric I would have kept it.,2,265
Delivered folded. Very cheap material. Hard to bend back in shape.,2,66
Too much padding in the chest,2,29
Doesn't stick on warm days...,2,29
The fabric is gorgeous but runs very small<br />I ordered one size more and it fits too tight  :'(,2,98
After first wash started coming apart.,2,38
The buried half zip is a royal pain. Zipper is pretty cheap and where it is installed you fight your natural curves to get it zipped.,2,133
"Top fits too big in the bust size, otherwise it's a nice suit",2,61
"fell apart after 2 months, decent for the price",2,47
"The buttons come undone really easy, going to sew it shut as it fits over my head. Husband bought for me. Would never do buttons in bed myself.",2,143
Pants not for tall girls I’m 5’9 165 pounds pants are beyond high waters BUT I love the material I love the shirt and the over coat came just as picture super soft and comfy !!!,2,177
I ordered a 2x but the shiry was very tight across the bust. The top is from China.The top was well packaged without any wrinkles or bad smell.,2,143
"This is a really weird shape. Its tight and bunchy at the bottom making the bottom of it stay behind you all the time. But, the sleeves are long, which I need for my long arms. The color does not look anything like the pictures, I ordered pink.",2,244
cute but very cheaply made.  bends easily.,2,42
Too small and the material is very thin. Would not purchase again.,2,66
Very cute. I washed it once and didn’t dry it and it shrunk so much I can’t wear it.  I didn’t even wear it yet either! What a joke! I fit perfect before I washed it.,2,166
This ring was crudely made,2,26
The dress was as pictured but it fit so weird and the material was very cheap feeling. I returned it because the top part of the dress was way too large.,2,153
This product feel like plastic. I thought it would have a metal feeling. The bracelet is dull and not as shiny as it looks in the picture.,2,138
"Buttons are not real, just sewn on, waistline hit my ribcage, so it makes me look pregnant. Skirt nowhere near as full as pictured",2,130
"It is made well enough, but like many others, is just too small and constricting.",2,81
"To set the time you turn the knob the opposite direction than you are familiar with, the crystal is plastic and the strap isn't leather. I suppose for $20 it's a watch you don't care what happens to it, that's a plus - so one more star.",2,236
Only lasted a month before parts started falling off the mask.,2,62
Very short.,2,11
Made cheaply and are not as big as shown in photo. My grand daughter could not wear them because they made her ears infected. They are made of some crappy &#34;in between&#34; metal ... it's probably not even metal. I won't buy anything from this vendor ever again.,2,265
Haven’t even washed it yet and it’s pulling. Terrible quality.,2,62
I really didn't like the fabric or the way it fit.,2,50
"I loved the coat but was disappointed because it was advertised  to have a front zipper, that was one of the main reasons for buying this particular jacket, I haven’t worn it still trying to decide to keep or send it back, if there is one with a front zipper I would like to exchange it",2,286
they feel kind of cheap.,2,24
This dress arrived with a hole where the tied bow should be. Such a shame because it would have been a cute dress.,2,114
Just Half of the lights work. I won't buy it again.,2,51
The size was bigger than my usual. I will definitely go smaller next time. The bottom part of the bra underneath my breast was a little itchy as well as the straps. My next order would not include any frills just plain material.,2,228
Wear a small to medium us size...ordered a large to be sure it fit...it came and was much much much too small.  can't wear. Even their xl will not fix based on this one here...they must be very little people,2,207
On description it says up to 48&#34; but it is way shorter than that,2,68
Earrings are not as nice as picture shown here. Wouldn't buy again.,2,67
Loved the style. The clasp slides & doesn’t stay at all. I got it to my wrist look down & it’s loosened up. Almost lost it a few times. Can’t wear it. Dissatisfied & disappointing...,2,182
"Disliked the material. Very cheap, thin. And uncomfortable. Not true to size",2,76
The watch is nice but a bit big and bulky for my taste,2,54
"Pretty but completely the wrong size. Listing description says they are 1.5cm long, and they are 1.5 inches long. Huge difference. Sime of them also were dull and had glue around them..",2,185
"Nothing like the picture, this is not a crewneck sweatshirt, it’s a long sleeve t-shirt.",2,88
I was dissapointed how small it was.,2,36
These are nice but surprisingly small when my son put them on it looked like they were glasses for children. My son is 19 years old.,2,132
Kinda too hard to use. Big and cheap.,2,37
I ordered two sizes larger than usual. It's still a bit small.,2,62
Pockets are in a horrible place. I ended up removing them.,2,58
"This footie is too wide, doesn't have elastic at the ankle and the buttons are far apart.  Thus, my baby is constantly getting her leg up into the pajamas and then her foot goes out a hole between snaps.",2,203
"Although a bit small, it didn't provide any of the &#34;up&#34; hoped for.  I would not recommend this for other than pure novelty.",2,131
"flatted easily, no support",2,26
Bands are little short for fase mask,2,36
"Sigh, I could not fit this",2,26
Cute bracelets but after wearing them over night both started to fall apart.  The colored twine on the adult bracelet unwound while sleeping. The child’s slip knot came undone and had to retie it with a different knot.,2,218
I like the color but is pretty thin and see through! And is not very forgiving! It will show any imperfections!,2,111
"I liked the fit, the color (grey) but I didn't like the material because it wrinkles too much.  I wouldn't buy it again for that reason.  I would prefer blouses that are made with a combination of polyester and cotton that will hardly show any wrinkles.",2,253
Uncomfortable under arm area,2,28
Pants are super short in length.,2,32
"Very cheap zipper, worried about breaking it in just carefully trying it on.  Sleeves are very tight. If you are a pear shape, this might work for you.",2,151
Not to happy with this change colors,2,36
"Look and feel as expected, but these run very small... Choose a size up if you order.",2,85
"Will not buy again, poor quality! Junk",2,38
Its really small and the details don’t come out as well as in the picture,2,73
They were comfortable when you first put them on but then in a couple of hours they rip between the fingers,2,107
The top wasn’t as long as the picture indicated,2,47
inseam length is very important to know<br />40 could be longer surprised there is no 42<br />otherwise a nice nice product,2,123
"Quality isn't good.  Thin and flimsy. Not sure it's really packable. Came out of the package bent and wrinkled, and stayed that way. Sent it back.",2,146
Got all other shirts the size he wears but this one was too long,2,64
"The eyes are not good. Poorly positioned and hard plastic with mesh, hard to see out of, can see the seams of eyes too much",2,123
This dress is not very cute. My boyfriend said it looks good but it was pretty shapeless on me. You get what you pay for I guess,2,128
The purse is very nice looking and the inside is roomy. Unfortunately the opening to the inside is quite narrow which made using this purse very difficult. I had to struggle to get my wallet out and then back inside. Had to stop using it.,2,238
"Meh, it's small and passible. Not as bad as their blue pattern",2,62
The color of the grey purse is totally different than what the picture shows. I would not have chosen this color of even this purse if I had known,2,146
The inside lining is torn at the seam. It can only be worn with the strap over the left shoulder. Didn't last a week.,2,117
Small sized short tail.  Cheap shirt.  Like the logo just wish it was on a better shirt.,2,88
Quality is good but runs VERY small...the company gave us a half return credit to keep it and reorder but the second one in a larger size is a little small as well.,2,164
For numerous reasons I can't recommend this brand.,2,50
very light material no structure to it so its good for summer or a situation where you just want loose/casual. Nice color but I am returning it.,2,144
Needed to buy a insole. To hard. Flexed with foot well. Problem only lasted a couple months as the rubber on the bottom snapped .,2,129
"I didn't have high expectations for this dress being that it cost $6. This was far worse than I thought. The material was like a kids costume and far too thick to wear in the summer. I am not saying not to purchase it. However, Just know what you are getting.",2,259
way to small,2,12
My gift recipient loved the blouse and the fit. Unfortunately it had a hole in it.,2,82
"It's a nice keychain, but after 2 months on a set of keys, the silver color started to wear off, and the small loop broke. It's unfortunate.",2,140
No support. Did not fit good,2,28
they are pretty but two of them lasted 1-2 days and broke.,2,58
"Nice material but not compression level at all. On top of that, it rolls up easily. Niki biki tank tops give more compression than this brand.",2,142
Not the color pictured.,2,23
"I used this tote to store my medicine. After 2-3 weeks of use, the handle pulled away from the body. The tote isn't even holding 5 pounds!",2,138
"It is adorable, BUT super flimsy.  My daughter will love it because it is Sanrio - me not so much and I am grateful I only bought it as a Christmas stocking stuffer.",2,165
Print was nice but the slippery material made them ride down below my cotton underwear. I had to constantly pull the up. Would not recommend.,2,141
A lot longer than I expected.,2,29
Item didnt fit exactly like the pic. Runs big. I am 5'1 and 115lbs. The small was loose. More like a medium. No other problems with item.,2,137
Nice jacket but buttons not securely sewn on. All 4 buttons feel off the first week! Fits well.,2,95
"Pretty when it hits the light just right, but the sizing is way off! Used the size chart to match my pointer finger, and it runs way big and falls off my finger.... very sad I can't even wear it",2,194
The product was good but in the picture it look bigger but to my surprise it was small,2,86
"I loved the fit and everything about this dress, until the strap broke my first time wearing. Quality is lacking.",2,113
Ii was a tshirt not a crop.,2,27
I  like it but I Ordered 2 and only received 1,2,46
I thought this fabric looked much better in the pictures. I didn’t like how this looked on me either. It fit a little weird so I’m not sure why it has such good reviews. Bought it for a funeral but I should have returned it! Way too expensive for what you’re getting.,2,267
"I ordered the size of pants I usually order, but these run larger than normal.  Be sure to check out the measurements for each size.  These are nice knit pants, but the size I ordred was way to big on me.",2,204
Way to big,2,10
It's cute but way too small. I gave it to my niece! Looks cute on her.,2,70
"I got 2 shirts normal size, green one is lengthy and after 3-4 wash fabric is getting worse with stitching getting worse for the green one",2,138
"I think this dress is adorable. And the quality was good. But the material stretches not at all, so unless I have zero intentions of ever lifting my arms, I couldn’t ever wear it. And I’m not so sure a larger size would have changed that fact. Unfortunately, I had to return this one.",2,284
The color did not look same as the picture.,2,43
Much shorter in length then what was advertised - cute -,2,56
I really like the design but it is just too short for my daughter even though I bought a couple sizes up.,2,105
too baggy,2,9
I did not like this fabric. It felt like plasticky cotton and had an odd shine.<br /><br />One of the least nice items I've received from Yesno.,2,144
"It's light weight. I bought this brand four years ago. The quality is not the same, disappointed.",2,97
Was hoping that it was stronger. Won’t hold a whistle.,2,54
Necklace broke on the first time wearing it.  Not worth the purchase!,2,69
Was a little small,2,18
"I understand the value of this item was cheap, but many of the glasses came without being together.  Pieces fell out of the bag as I opened the packaging, and I had to put glasses back together.",2,194
I bought 2 bracelets 1 for each of my daughters and they both broke already.,2,76
"My daughter usually wears a 10, so I ordered a 12 just in case we needed alterations.<br />The dress didn’t zip because it was way too small.",2,141
"For reference I'm at 34DD and I ordered a large did not fit at all, ended up returning it.",2,90
Way to small!  They need to make larger pouches.  Fabric is nice!,2,65
Do not waste your money on this. Extremely lightweight - would it keep the heat off the head?? Very large and if you tighten it you end up with a big ugly lump hitting your head. No labels. Came folded and the folds will always be there.,2,237
Cute boots but the odor is so strong I can't stand to have them in the house. They will be returned .,2,101
The sizing is wrong on this and the inside of the material just wasn't as soft as advertised.,2,93
"It is very cute to look at, but it is VERY cheaply made.  The chain broke after only wearing it for a few hours.  Disappointed, but I guess it costs less for a reason.",2,167
Runs about a size small. Not particularly comfortable.,2,54
I bought this because I wanted a buckle type closure. Instead what I got is the same closure as the original band.,2,114
Much bigger than normal sunglasses that style and VERY cheap feeling.,2,69
"Stiff, rigid, scratchy, and not small enough.",2,45
I dislike it because it’s Because it’s too small,2,48
It's a very nice poncho ( for a 10 year old)......It is seriously way too small for any woman who does not have &#34; hobbit like&#34; proportions.  I'm trying to stretch it out with weights to lenghthen it.  I hate to return stuff.,2,232
"A belt for giants. Seriously, where do they come up with how they measure this?  36” my waist and there is no way this fits me yet it says it’s supposed to. This might fit 40-48” waist. I think they had overstock and just repacked these as 34-40.",2,246
"Cool and comfortable, but not very supportive. Made with very thin light weight fabric.",2,87
Too bulky and too long for petite people. I like the attached belt.,2,67
Had to buy a second one. After wearing for a day it starts falling apart. I do not recommend.,2,93
"Not made very well. The fitting for the closure (Clasps) frequently come undone and the bracelet falls off, Hard to put on by yourself and is cheaply made. Not worth the cost and i would not recommend purchasing the product till a better design for closing the clasp is made.",2,275
I don't know how to put it on<br /><br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯,2,50
"The product was too long, ad I could have used a 1X instead of a 2X.",2,68
The zipper broke right away,2,27
"The bezels are lovely, but 4 of the Cabochons were broken, making them unusable.  Paying for 10 pairs and only being able to make (and sell) 6, makes then a bit costly.",2,168
These are pretty bad. I know it's acheap price but I was not expecting the quality to be like this. They look like a toy for little girls dress up. They don't look like the product photo.,2,187
"Thin material. Way too small. Maybe it’s just the bigger sizes whose measurements aren’t correct? Ordered an XL, ended up having to reorder the biggest size and it still didn’t fit. I’m regularly a dress size 14. Ridiculous.",2,224
"Small fit, flimsy fabric",2,24
Not as nice as the Timeson one I ordered a couple months ago. The material has no body to it kinda like paper.,2,110
The dress is a little bit different from tbe picture,2,52
Super cute but cheaply made. ripped by the armpit after one wear.,2,65
"Poor quality on the seams and the fabric is heavy, which makes it look over-stretched.",2,86
"The sweater’s color was as shown in the photo. However, the material was not soft and the collar is tighter than what the picture shows. I am returning the item.",2,161
Runs really really small,2,24
"Wasn't impressed with this dress. The white part of the dress was dirty, and it was a bit stretched out, like someone wore it and then returned it.",2,147
"Pretty color, does not look like the picture when it is on.",2,59
to big bought bubble wrap instead,2,33
"Was hoping for a sturdy, comfortable, water/outdoor shoe for our toddler. Run small and aren't pliable enough to get on without straining impatient toddlers foot or parents hands. Also started fraying within a few days.",2,219
Very loose... it doesn't snap close.,2,36
Wow. I ordered a 3X because I like my PJs baggy. I can't even get these over my hips.<br />They are light weight and perfect for summer so I'll give them to my sister. Should have read the reviews but at least they were cheap :(,2,228
"Great leggings for under a tunic, but not really workout leggings. They are very soft, but not supportive at all.<br />Also, I got two black and one turquoise; no blue, like the order I placed. :(",2,196
"Just one trip identifying my luggage and a half was lost and the other damaged. Very fragile for the way guys treat luggage in travels by plane. I saw a guy carry my luggage using the strap and its broken in front of me. The idea to identify is great, but in mor civilized airports",2,281
"i usually use tanktops as undershirts and i cant with these, also the material feels weird",2,90
Very cheaply made. Weird fit.,2,29
I like the dress but the shoulder seams have already torn after 2 uses,2,70
I received the wrong color/style. They also roll down as I’m working out which is really frustrating. Roll of the dice I suppose.,2,129
Fits small definitely for a child or a very small person,2,56
"The first one i got was broken and then when I contacted about it they sent me another one free of charge which was awesome. Fair warning though, the draping chains do not lay perfectly flat and the head chain .. while cute... is not the easiest accesory to put on straight",2,273
had to walk from gravel driveway to grass and that must have broken down the plastic since halfway through the party the grass walkers had broken and slid up the spike of my heels!,2,180
"2 stars simply because it was super cute, but super tight.",2,58
"Love the style, fit, and look of this dress but extremely disappointed in the care instructions. This dress should be dry clean only but the instructions on the tag are to wash it.  The top turned green and the bottom is mis-colored after following the instructions and only washing one time.",2,292
I like that the pants look cute but they don’t fit correctly.,2,61
"Nice, it was for a gift.  Well received.  Arrived in a timely manner.",2,69
completely see through ..fabric is sooo thin its like crepe paper..looks and feels very cheap.,2,94
Not a matte patent-leather and flimsy at best. Has a pearlescent sheen and faux gold heart pulls. Not what was expected but probably on par for the price.,2,154
This shirt is extremely short. I got a medium and it barely hits my pant line.. definitely not as long as the picture shows. not something you can were with yoga pants unless your okay with showing everything! for reference I'm 5'8 130lb.,2,238
fits too tight.,2,15
Quality not there - flimsy.  I personally found them to be sort of goofy looking - I do use them as a extreme backup though.,2,124
Very cheap quality for the amount I spent. Feels like regular basketball shorts material. Left pocket already had a hole in the mesh. Pretty disappointed in the quality,2,168
Corre muy pequeño debes comprar un tamaño más grande,2,52
Sheds badly -- leaves red clumps wherever I walk,2,48
"The size is better for a child than an adult.  I have an average size head, but it was far too small.",2,101
"I returned it, the shirt looked dirty and stained. 2 stars because the shirt was a soft material.",2,97
Color wash is not at all what expected. If at all. And holes are cheaply cut into fabric. Fail.,2,95
"I received these earrings today and returned them right away. The wires are EXTREMELY thin and make them look cheap, nothing like in the picture. There is no weight to them at all. The Tanzanite gems are a decent size though. Still not worth $200.",2,247
The material seems good but has little stretch to it.  The mask is too small so the chin pocket rides up when you talk.,2,119
"Super cute, but the ear broke off on the first day...this was for an older child so it was not under undue stress.",2,114
This product is not what I expected itof a waxy substance would not buy again,2,77
"I normally use 0-2 size for dress and ordered Small size. It fitted somewhat large and I needed to return.<br />It looks better at the picture, the small flowers are not embroidered, they're printed. So it doesn't look so pretty.",2,229
Cute but tiny. Small is like a child’s medium,2,45
The material is cheap looking and the stitching was not correct.,2,64
Bad Color and material.,2,23
"These are so cute, but the quality is terrible. The fabric split from the soles the first time my daughter wore them ☹",2,118
"A tiny person may like these, but very unflattering on curves. My butt looks enormous in these for some reason. Fabric is very thin and they are tight.",2,151
The fit is fine but very thin material.  I have holes in the butt area after two months of minimal use.,2,103
"Short sleeves, I'm 5'11"" but mostly, unraveled at arm after 3 wears.",2,68
"Really cute and fit well, rated 2 stars because one of the top buttons fell off one of the straps after one wear.",2,113
This is a clunky oversized toooo chunky piece of jewelry. Not worth my money!!,2,78
"Purchased a XXL which should have fit and was way to small, more like a medium.",2,79
"The necklace on time; but the hook was on the side of the necklace, irregular product.  I had to purchase another necklace because of poor quality.",2,147
It’s not a cotton mask and material is too thin. I am not comfortable to let my daughter wear it outdoor.,2,105
One time use only but cute.,2,27
looked great but broke after a month of use.,2,44
Not good for women over 45 if your derriere has dropped at all. the elastic does not keep you in.  I believe someone else had the same review.  I should have heeded it.,2,168
Was not happy with this when i received it. It is like half the size that appears on the site. Very disappointed. Make sure you don't order if you are expecting it to be long.,2,175
"Its a beautiful dress, just not for short people with a large bust.",2,67
"I bought four of these thinking that they'd be just as beautiful as they look online. Unfortunately when they got here they looked really cheap even though they are, and you couldn't really tell the man and the woman in the center of the butterfly. Color wasn't as vibrant, but still looked good.",2,296
"Loved the style, but couldn't believe how dysproportionate the cups were. There was no chance in wearing it.",2,108
"Not as pretty in real life as it is in the picture. Also, it was a gift and the coat doesn’t have any tags on the outside or inside. Looks like it could’ve been worn already. Amazon’s sellers should start making tags on clothing. Not even a small/med /large tag - embarrassing",2,276
"Exactly what I should have expected for the price. A super cheap looking piece of costume jewelry. Would be great for a Hippie costume on Halloween, but you could never get away with wearing this anywhere seriously. Even a teen at the beach in a sundress would feel like it was embarrassing.",2,291
"The body part fit true to size, but the sleeves were very short. I needed about 2 more inches on them. The material also wasn't very soft, it was stiff and scratchy. I am 5'7 and ordered a S.",2,191
The material was heavy.  The dress wasn't as pretty and flowing as one might imagine from the description and photos,2,116
Sent it right back,2,18
"Not as cute on as it is in the pic,,",2,36
"While they look nice while folded, some the the rings are ill-fitted and don't actually spin. You can open the outermost ring because it grinds on the inner ring.",2,162
Absolutely gorgeous and well made but they got one of the stones the wrong color. still looks close to the correct color so not going through the hassle of getting a new one. 2nd image is of another item I got with the correct colors.,2,234
These pendants were very thin and flimsy the hole is very small you can not get a 1.5 mil snake chain thru them you will have to use a jump ring.,2,145
"I ordered a large- the top was too small, and the bottom was too big. It wasn't made out the African material I was thinking about, more on the silky side type of material.",2,172
"I ordered the burgundy sweater. The listing did well to explain that it would be oversized and it certainly was. I'm 5'4, 140 lbs and it almost reaches my knees. Lastly, the one I received wasn't a v-neck as depicted.",2,217
Too long and uncomfortable,2,26
I can't close it all the way. The material is too strong.,2,57
"These did nothing for reducing glare, which was my main reason for buying them.  I could not notice any difference with either pair. As a matter of fact, the night vision lens actually made the glare worse.",2,206
"Excellent bifocals, I cannot knock that but I have seen zero evidence of them being photochromic.",2,97
Way too big and not flattering,2,30
"Returned this dress. The sleeves were tight and had no give whatsoever. It was ok, but not very flattering.",2,107
The slit for the knot comes up too high. Thought it’d be more at waistline.,2,75
"Well made, but for an American adult, it is more sized for a school aged child.",2,79
The black part is too short - it looked dumb and the fabric wasn't to my expectations. I returned it.,2,101
"I took my husband's measurements before I ordered, and ordered a size up. Still incredibly small. I wouldn't recommend this product.",2,132
cheaply made. I love the look but they break really easy,2,56
These absolutely cannot be worn.  They are too long.  They hang a good 1/2 inch below your teeth so there's no way to close your mouth without looking like you have a fat lip.  Would work fine for Halloween but cannot be worn if you intend on speaking.,2,252
The hood was cool but the design in the shirt was poor quality. Not worth the price spent,2,89
too small...<br /><br />Thanks!,2,31
"My son liked the look of this shoe, but the traction is horrible. He switched back to his old pair.",2,99
Picture is smaller than pictured and fabric looks faded.,2,56
"This ring looks cheap, which I guess it is.  I was underwhelmed so I returned the ring. Also, my engagement ring is a Cathedral set and the ring didn’t match up well with it.  Save your money up and invest in a nice wedding band.",2,229
"They were nice, except 3 of the six pair, the threading was messed up, requested a replacement, had to wait almost a week for them, the new set had 2 pair with the threads messed up. Price is good, but the old saying, ""you get what you pay for"" applies fully here.",2,264
Too cheaply made for the price I paid!,2,38
It is beautiful but unfortunately it was way too wide to fit into my cartilage piercing :(,2,90
Great looking boot...it’s pretty loose fit in the foot...the calves are SO tight you’d have to be a 14yr old teenager to have them fit. They’re straight up and if you stretched em I’m sure it’d mess with the integrity of the boot. Disappointed for sure!,2,253
Got all scratched up and I don’t even know how.  Got a different Zelda ring that won’t get all scratched up.  Really disappointed with the quality.,2,147
"For me, the screw backs are impossible. Are tiny and hard to get on and screw in. Tried another back, but of course it doesn't fit. Have stopped trying to wear them. I don't like earrings that I have to fuss with",2,212
These are HUGE and very loose on the face,2,41
We got married September 15th 2018 and the black part on the ring has worn off big time....Didn't expect that...I guess it is true...You get what you pay for!,2,158
Mask is too large...,2,20
It was wayyyyyy toooo small. I ordered it for a friend and ordered it 1 size bigger. They do not use the size chart that they provide. I ordered a 5xl and it was like an adult small.,2,182
"I purchased this as a gift, and it did not come packaged with the cute little verse as shown. Necklace was as shown.",2,116
knots came undone,2,17
"I was very dissapointed. I had bought this for my mom as a last minute gift, and it looked like if i had bought it a the .99¢ Store. Not worth the money.",2,153
My son loved the color of the shoes and was very disappointed at the fit.. I had to return them.and go with a different brand,2,125
Dress is super cute but runs super small XL fits like a medium will be returning.,2,81
Elastic stretched out and made these unusable.,2,46
The black ones are a different size than the grey ones.  Much smaller and not proper quality.  Try another brand these aren't consistent I sizing and quality.,2,158
Not my style.,2,13
Super cute designs... however i didn’t even get these wet and they turned my toes green. gross!!,2,96
"It’s cute but the material is cheap and extremely scratchy. The inside of the bonnet is the roughest part, which defeats the purpose of buying this to protect my curly hair. The band is not only itchy but is also too tight and gives me a headache.",2,247
"How are you supposed to catch em all with only one glove. Top and hat are fine, the only glove we received was very poor quality.",2,129
Really nice belt but the hook that keeps it together isn't long enough so I have only worn once and would never purchase another one . It's a shame because the ornate part of the buckle is really wonderful.,2,206
"Good quality, but not worth paying 3 times the price of an &#34;average&#34; wallet.",2,84
It looked a little matronly for my taste.,2,41
"Really like them, quality is similar to my more expensive blenders. HOWEVER mine came almost un-usably scratched pretty badly in the direct center of vision on my left eye.  Super annoying, wouldn't buy this brand again",2,219
i would size down. im a 135 size small 5'5 and it just is a little long and wide on me,2,86
It’s a cheaper version of the pictures. The accent openings are smaller than pictured. Obviously a knockoff. Disappointed. Will donate to Goodwill.,2,147
Definitely not long enough. Came above my belly button. If you have a C cup or larger I would not buy this.,2,107
"The dress was not cut straight across the front. It dipped down below the belt line, so it made my daughter look like she had a belly.",2,134
Not a good fit and the should straps don't cut it.,2,50
Arrived quickly but is way too big for my ear,2,45
I ordered these for my 13 year old. They were too long/big for her. These are adult sized earrings.....IMO. I returned them.,2,124
The material of the shoes is too hard and it does not feel comfortable for my toddler,2,85
Fit was terrible. Wrong in all the right places.,2,48
Cheap. Thin. Bends.,2,19
This is very very see through,2,29
"They are not made for nose ring, gave to my friend for her eyebrow",2,66
Plastic like and tight.,2,23
it is not made well seems like someone made it at home not like the stores have,2,79
Dosent look the same at all,2,27
"Although small, the sweater is more medium/large.",2,49
Wow. I ordered a 4x and it fits like a large...<br /><br />I really would not recommend this at all.<br /><br />*I received this at a discounted price in return  for my opinion,2,176
No appropriate! Short!,2,22
"This ""sweatshirt"" is more like a tshirt.  It's super thin and not worth the money",2,81
"I ordered 2 of the. White and purple.<br />White - beautiful, great fabric, dress looks really nice (wrinkled)<br />Purple cheap material, badly made, nothing like the white one. Even the brands are different.. not sure if its by color or basically whatever they have but purple is going back.",2,293
"I don't like the purse I contacted the seller as well as Amazon, I was not able to return it.",2,93
"I love how reflective the hat is, but it is itchy and the top came unstitched.",2,78
"Color was nice. Dress was heavy, took a long time to lace up corset back and returning was a downright nightmare!",2,113
Idk why these have such good reviews?! They’re literally curved so much that the cuter top part just hangs downward. Hard to explain… but pretty disappointing. Would not recommend to anyoneeeeeee,2,195
The hair part was so small my son could not keep it on his head. The costume is low quality but perhaps that is to be expected due to cost.,2,139
"The beads are nice, but both of them the beads started to fall off. Very disappointed that this started to happen in several weeks.",2,131
Too small not what I expected,2,29
Broke within 1 minute of wearing,2,32
"Like the other reviewers, the item I received does not look like the photo in the listing. It is one strand with multiple colored pearls.  It isn't horrible, but it is not what I wanted and not worth price (even the deal of the day price). Will be returning this necklace.",2,272
Way to small. I had to send back.,2,33
"Not even a sweater. It is made of t-shirt material and cheap thin material at that. I followed the sizing from the reviews, and it was still.way too small. Thankfully, i could turn right around and give to my mom. Early Christmas for her!",2,238
Too big.  Which is hard to believe because almost all sunglasses I buy are way too small.  They fit my head well and have a wide bridge for my nose.  The lenses are just ridiculous.  They'd be great for a rave or any other occasion that calls for hiding your eyeballs.,2,268
They are smashed down in the package and the brim is nearly vertically down it doesn't stick out forward at all. See photos.,2,124
wrong colors - 4M and 1 LG for some reason - first wash - the hem came out of one and the binding around the neck on an other separated so there's a hole - not happy - waste of money,2,182
"It is made of quality matierials, however, it arrived in the wrong size. I sent it back and got a refund for a different product.",2,129
"I so wanted to like this suit, the skirt fit great, the top... not so much. very il fitting for breasts, it was too small and the underwire would flip up and the swimsuit would fold down at the top",2,197
No the best quality of fabric. It burns really easy. It caught on fire when I wad cooking. To me it’s a really bad purchase.,2,124
It's pretty but scratchy and catches on everything.,2,51
"Nice cover up, but only covered torso...thought it would at least cover the top portion of my bottom so that I could walk around the resort semi-covered. I am 5'7 and 120 lbs...maybe better for a shorter woman....returned it....",2,228
These bras are very pretty and extremity small ... I had really high hopes .. But no ! I'm a 36DD there's no way these would work even wearing around the house . I wouldn't recommend,2,182
Sizes ran too small on both granddaughters.,2,43
My feet slide to much,2,21
This looks great BUT the sizing is WRONG it is suppose to be a 2X looks like a small or medium shirt.  It's not worth my time to send it back.  Don't dare to try again. To bad it is a cute shirt.,2,195
Only three of the hoops balls actually screws off. I'll have to try with pliers but so far it's been really difficult.,2,118
Doesn’t really stay on my wrist because Magnet doesn’t stay connected. Ended up purchasing a different band. Don’t recommend.,2,125
Cute dress on the website: but the one I received was paper thin and not a good fit. The material wasn’t right.,2,111
"Multiple pairs have fallen apart after one wear. Post came separated from earring when trying to remove back. If you don’t mind to repair with superglue then ok to purchase... cute and trendy at a good price, quality is lackluster",2,230
"Runs large.  Once I saw in person, I decided it wasn't for me.  In the process of returning.",2,92
Snaps are popping off right out of bag. So disappointed with quality of these shirts.,2,85
When I ordered them I expected them to be a lot bigger like “over sized” and yet they were very tiny and they broke within days,2,127
"I bought this for a Timex 22mm lug-width watch. The leather straps were a little too wide and too thick to fit between the pins and the watch. Also, the band was much too stiff and the particular shade of brown was very bland, lacking the richness of other brown Nemesis straps.",2,278
"Very small, great looking shirts!",2,33
"These were great while they lasted. Fun designs but these shrunk in the first wash. I didn't see any care or handling instructions on line or included in the package, Too bad, I would have gotten another pair.",2,209
Not for me.,2,11
"I ordered a seven and it didn't fit, it was way too small. I was able to give it to my mom, who wears a five,  so it's not a total waste.",2,137
"Not crazy about these - usually I wear Spalding but thought I would give these a try...while the rear and upper thigh fit snugly, the fabric area around the knee is loose and a bit baggy giving a rather sloppy appearance rather than the streamlined look I prefer...I wouldn't buy this brand again.",2,297
Seems like a comfortable shirt but too tight around hips and buttocks area. Order up a size.,2,92
Shoes were great at first but shoes did not last 2 weeks before sole came undone.,2,81
Color fades after the first wash.,2,33
"Too small, thin material and listed as grey but it's actually a tan color.",2,74
"I received a dirty, torn package. Upon opening package and taking bands out of package the bands looked like they had been in someone's attic for a 100 years. Luckily with a little hard work and hot water they are usable.",2,221
Didn't pay a lot. Sleeves too long and fabric flimsy.,2,53
The material is not as expected. Do not like it. Will be returning it. Otherwise it probably would have been a nice outfit.,2,123
Looks nice but cheaply made. Tried to make it smaller and all the pins are cracking in half which makes it hard to put them back in.,2,132
This material is extraordinarily odd. It is thick and not comfortabltable. Return was easy.,2,91
Still to big for my head.,2,25
Too large in crotch area of shorts.,2,35
"I am 5 foot 10in tall.  Returning dress as if I dear bend over, I will be showing all",2,85
this looks very different from the picture,2,42
"2 of them have already came apart. They have been used in an office environment and we are not even rough with them, only a pulled of people use them.",2,150
"Straight cut, especially the pants. If you have a hint of curves order a size or two up.",2,88
Thin material.  Something to wear around close friends.,2,55
They arrived broken and flat as a piece of paper.,2,49
"I will fully admit I did not check the mm size when compared to my face size, but I do not have a particularly large head by any means. These are well-sized for children and that's about it.",2,190
Size isn’t true! Order up like 2 sizes.,2,39
"It is a super cute shorts but it runs very small either way if you up to the largest size, it doesn’t stretch. Love the design but I would love to see more sizes",2,161
Too wide.  Hard to keep on and not soft as advertised.,2,54
This dress looked nothing like the photo - it was much shorter and the sleeves were longer in person. The coloring was also weird.,2,130
one watch not work,2,18
"Glasses are good... just way to big and with real glass, heavy.",2,63
too clingy to suit me,2,21
It did not clean well. I dripped something  washed it off immediately and still have s stain. Not happy with this and eould discourage people to purchase.,2,154
Sizing is definitely off,2,24
The colors are very dull.  Doesn't look like the ad.  Material seems cheap.,2,75
"it is narrow and long, the pattern is blurry and the fabric feels cheap, I wish I hadn't ordered it.",2,100
"Wore in colder dry temps and the tips of my fingers were freezing. Also, the tips of the fingers are long making it difficult to use fingers when wearing. Returned.",2,164
They break if the wind blows against them,2,41
"nice design, poor quality... NO POCKETS (well, not much)<br /><br />The top (standard) pockets have almost no depth...  so be prepared to lose your keys, your cell phone and anything else you need, because the mfgr was too cheap to make a pocket worth having.",2,259
"Item is larger than described, and poor quality. Returned it.",2,61
"After one time laundry wash, the cloth shrinked to super small!",2,63
"I feel like an issue I'm having with this style of dress lately is that the elastic waist is set right under the bust and not at the waist. This would make a great maternity dress, but does not show off my shape!",2,212
"Cheap feel to them.. I got two pair on QVC that were the same brand as these but the quality from the QVC glasses is 1000% better. I thought I was getting the same thing, since QVC didn't carry them anymore. but they feel like $5.00 sunglasses from Walmart.",2,257
Fits small bought a large and was snug.,2,39
$3.50 ok value just take care of it my 2yr old granddaughter easily broke it,2,76
"If you like your clothes transparent this is for you,  gotta love those pointy shoulders that hang off too.",2,107
"I searched for oversized, boxy tees. What I received was hip hugging, stretchy material that was in NO way an XL. I will be returning the 2 tees as soon as Ice Week is over here in Texas.",2,187
I ordered 2XL and it fit like a large,2,37
Missing a stone. I'll just chalk it up to a loss because I'm not repacking and going 15 minutes out my way to return it. At least one is 100% usable.,2,149
There are two very odd pleats that sit right above the breast that made the whole shirt lay weird. This is now a sleep/house shirt.,2,131
Top looks nice its a good material.  The flared out part is really big. Maybe its the style? Or maybe its a maternity  top?,2,123
This shirt is not a midum for American males. To small . I will give it as a gift to someone.  If I washed it  there is no way to get it over my shoulders .,2,156
"These fit great, except they are really short... think crop top.",2,64
Very pretty but cheap hardware makes this wallet unusable.  The metal clasps and magnet that holds the wallet closed is of such poor quality that it opens at the slightest pressure.  I would be very concerned about losing contents.  I am returning this wallet.,2,260
Returning it don't like how it looks in person or on,2,52
"Omg! These are the worst house shoes ever !! The pics look like they are comfortable because of all the fur, but when you wear them they’re extremely uncomfortable because the sole is hard ! Your feet will be throbbing after walking in them !!<br /><br />I’m irritated because I wasted my MONEY!!",2,296
"I love the outside of the mask and the Tigger picture.  I also liked that you are able to adjust the ear loops.  I did not like the inside material, it is irritating to my nose.  (It caused my nose to itch).  I washed it and hoped that it would help to resolve this, but unfortunately it did not.",2,296
"Won't stay on my face, way to big,",2,34
Very disappointed because it is a dark grey with hardly any blue hues. I loved the blue in pic.  There was not a get to choose. It was white or blue. I have the white and love it. I get lots of compliments. Can where it casual or a little dressy. I just wanted the blue. Not sure if I will return it,2,299
Not bad. Looks nothing like the picture,2,39
I was not a pictured. Ran small.,2,32
"I really wanted to like this. It could have been very cute, but has some serious design flaws. I am 5 feet tall and the sleeves were way too short. It’s also more of a crop style so needs to be worn with high waisted pants. I would have kept it if the sleeves had been longer.",2,276
The lens are not dark. Will not filter sunlight!!! Frames are cute but they are useless.,2,88
"The chest area is about 2 inches smaller then it says it is.  The dress would have possibly been great.  Unfortunately, to get to the point where everything fit it looked like a discombobulated tent down together with spare parts.",2,230
Loved the out fit however up around the are part too small fits super tight... returned,2,87
"Its not very loud, not what I expected to receive. I was disappointed when I received it.",2,89
The small crystal was off center and awkward. After a few washes the shirt looked worn out.,2,91
"I am not a fan. It is a bit short, and the cuffs are really small. I expected a better quality garment.",2,103
Really cute but way smaller than they look,2,42
Found it too floppy.  Wasn't attractive on.,2,43
Cute but much smaller than expected. I like loose and comfy.,2,60
"They are very small, not worth the money spent",2,46
"Beautiful watch but quit working almost immediately.  I would wear it and it would stop working.  Sometimes after I took it off, it would start working again, only to stop shortly thereafter.",2,191
The product was too small. It was delivered as promised timely and efficiently.,2,79
On this one you get what you pay for. Very inexpensive feel to this watch,2,73
Very comfortable.,2,17
Functional.. Not fancy. Just as expected,2,40
It’s really nice.,2,17
"I had to give these away because they were GIANT. SO SO Giant. My face is a heart/round shape, but they just made me look like a bug. My eyebrows didn't show like the models... Quality of the product was great in my opinion, they were a nice weight and sturdy. Came in a cute bag and box.",2,288
"Looks cheap, poor quality.  You get what you pay for.",2,53
The material is good but it runs big. It's deal for somebody who is size 6 and up.,2,82
"Nice color, but cheap looking.",2,30
I didn't realise the blue colour was varied.  I had hoped for a solid blue.  Nice bag otherwise.,2,96
It bunched up uncomfortably around my waist and the zipper buckled up front when I was seated. Maybe the bra version is better.,2,127
I'm between a 1xl or 2xl but I got a 3xl because it run small. But didn't fit so I got gave it to a friend. But the black color is nice and looks like the pic,2,158
These are super cute. They turned my daughter's thumb blue..,2,60
It made my neck itchy and it turned black. Very cheap material. You get what you pay for. But it is cute.,2,105
I was not happy with the product said it had red lenses which is one of the color is recommended for playing golf come to find out the red is on the outside and vision wise it is gray!,2,184
"Was way too large, and the straps are not as nicely placed on the neck/chest as pictured, but instead are loose, droopy and odd looking. All-in-all is an unattractive fitting top, which is a shame because it's very comfortable.",2,227
Way too dark for wearing while driving.,2,39
"The product fit was not good. The pants were ok until they split around both thighs. I understand Asian sizes are known to be smaller, but there should be xl and 2xl sizes for more customers.",2,191
The sizing is way off for this sports bra. I’m usually a size small and the medium was even way too snug. I like the fabric & it feels like good quality but it’s too tight and uncomfortable so I will be returning.,2,213
"Cute style but one of the most uncomfortable tennis shoes I've ever worn.  You would think for the price these would be comfortable, but they are heavy, stiff and tight. Wouldn't reccomend.",2,189
Not the quality expected,2,24
"All pictures do not accurately depict true earrings. Sadly, they look inexpensive. The worst part is they came broken. The stud is detached from the post. I was unable to glue it back on. Very upset.",2,199
"Definitely fit as expected, stitching perfectly fine, but the problem is the material itself. Plastic feeling--100% polyester and the seams feel very cheap. Just trying it on made me feel hot--does not breathe well at all. Color stripes don't align properly. Overall just does not feel/look right.",2,297
"Cute dress if you're tiny. I have a long torso, bust line of the dress cuts across the bottom half of my bra, does not sit at waist like pictured.",2,146
First one arrived with a dead battery- still waiting for ups to pick- up.,2,73
I did not like the material at all,2,34
Scratched first day.,2,20
"I purchased a size larger knowing it would possibly fit smaller. It is smaller, howeverUlove the dress and will keep.",2,117
"It's a lovely shirt,  and the fit is exact. However, I ordered the blue flowered but received the maroon flowered. Being that blue was the selling point for me, but I received the wrong color, I wish thinks could be different.",2,226
It feels great and very light but comes off very easily.  Very sad b/c I like how it feels on my wrist.  :(,2,107
Extremely small,2,15
The o-ring backs do not stay on well. One of them came off a week after having them.,2,84
"They pull at my ears, and then actually pop off my face with the slightest of touching.  Not comfortable for a regular size adult man.",2,134
Before buying these really check kids size ordered a 5for my granddaughter and they fit me I’m a women’s 9,2,106
"There's no hint of argan oil that this bonnet claims to have. When I'd get them in the past from the beauty supply store, I'd at least smell the argan oIL treatment in it.",2,171
"I liked how soft these feel inside and outside, but I could not find a pair that fit me, despite using the size guide.  I bought one pair (then returned them), then bought three more pairs (going up one size each time).  I gave up trying to buy these after 3-4 pairs did not fit me.",2,282
"Disappointed in the fabric. Can't believe they moved to such poor quality fabric, way too thin. You can see right through to skin. I always purchase Hanes products, but this was disappointing.",2,192
It was a nice short i was really excited to wear it.<br />I washed it the next day (with my whites like I always do) and I came out dingy and no there is nothing wrong with my washer because I washed another new white blouse in the Same load and it did not come out like this,2,275
"Very, very small/tight. I have a normal size head and shape for a woman. This does not sit well on my head. It looks like good quality, and color is as pictured on the webpage.",2,176
Have only had this bracelet a short time but I am very disappointed as it already looks to be tarnishing.,2,105
Runs small. Not a professional look- looks cheap. Liked the lining but not the jacket material. Purchased the blazer in two different colos (black & white). Returned both.,2,171
Uncomfortable - sizing inaccurate,2,33
Very costume jewelry looking compared to my original one that was stolen,2,72
Cute but runs way small,2,23
The color is actually a creamy yellow. It is not a true white. I will be returning.,2,83
These are very small and do not fit a standard bra.,2,51
"Very thin material, wanted heavier and stronger material for outside chores but  not durable. Ok for inside, lounging I suppose",2,127
My nephew doesn't like Polyester so I will return it.,2,53
Size up a full size!,2,20
Cheap iron on,2,13
Necklace missing from package.,2,30
Haven’t had for 3 months and color started to rub off. Only gave 2 stars because my watch did stay on my wrist.,2,111
You get what you paid for. The stitches started unraveling after a few hours of wearing. Normally wear a Xl I ordered a 2XL and was still unable to zip up all the way. The material does not stretch at all. Very cute for just pictures and wearing for a short amount of time.,2,273
Out of two pairs one has wat looks like r<br />Left over super glue on the part that rests on your ear cord is two short,2,120
It is definitely not a workout shirt. It does not fit snug and I’ve an athletic build . Was hoping to wear it to the gym to see those pumps but guess that isn’t happening. Bummer product,2,186
Shrunk so much after first wash.  Too small now.,2,48
cute but runs very small.,2,25
I dont get the rubber so called adjustable piece's.  They are always falling off. I wish I knew it was like that before I bought them.  I wouldn't buy them.,2,156
It enhanced my stomach roles.  This is one Spanx item that I would pass on.,2,75
"Bought to wear to work for our Valentine’s Day theme party, but it arrive two days late and was a bust. Also, the fabric is so rough and not flexible at all-very stiff and uncomfortable.",2,186
"Print and material were weird, had to return. Did not like on.",2,62
broke before i got to wear it. cute tho.,2,40
Tarnished my ear,2,16
Returned these shorts. The hip pocket would not even fit a standard size wallet. The material was also very thin and looked cheap imo.,2,134
Bought this for my mom fits her wrist which is very small but do sent form well to the shape of small wrists,2,108
"The point of buying this shirt was to have some support without seeing my bra like most of my white tank tops. This shirt, however, still showed the padding. The padding also was too high and felt awkward. Did not fit like workout shirts with built in padding.",2,260
Too small for adults<br />Ok for children<br />A waste  I of I my I money,2,73
Zipper cam apart first week and seams can undone after about a month.,2,69
"While there is extra fabric at the chest, it is only at that spot.  The rest of the shirt is see through.  Would have been 100x better if the fabric was doubled up on the entire shirt.  I won't be able to wear it and missed the return deadline if there was one.",2,261
Huge and not a comfortable fabric at all.,2,41
Product quality is okay. Arrived 2 weeks late.<br />Have to pay to return it to China,2,85
The stitching at the toe is a little tough and not as comfortable as expected in my sneaker.,2,92
When I got purse I absolutely loved it. However in just a month the straps tore from purse. It was not heavy enough that you would think this would happen. It’s a nice style and spacious. Just be careful as it seems to only manage very minimal in weight.,2,254
sizing was not right. i wear a med. ordered a xl. too small. china sizing,2,73
I returned this item because the Velcro on the side of strap would rub against my ankle.,2,88
You can see through it,2,22
They are ok. Not as well made others I have. The plastic is thinner and rest on my face a little crooked causing my regular glasses to push on my eye lashes.,2,157
Every pair I have gotten develops tears in the calf area within two months.,2,75
I’m 5’9. Bust 34. Waist 27. Hips 36. Ordered the medium but it didn’t fit. Quaility and fit didn’t meet my expectations,2,119
Doesn't look cute in person kind of baggy,2,41
"Can’t say I liked, never worn. At least 2 sixes too BIG. Returned",2,65
"I really liked this product, it was bright and fully covered my son. But after 4 uses the zipper broke 😖 so now I can’t use it.",2,127
Didn't fit the way it looks in the item picture. It was too large making it look frumpy,2,87
It faded terribly after one wash. Love this style and have bought other products but this particular fabric did not last one wash!,2,130
Cute dress. I thought would be a full dress. Very short.,2,56
Weird shape. Sewn uneven. Peplum is awkward,2,43
Disappointed. It broke 2nd day. Need to have it fixed.,2,54
Not what I expected.  The pattern didn't line up.  I'm returning.<br />Material is ok though.,2,93
I own several Calvin Klein bras. They are all fairly comfortable. I returned this one because it was very stiff and uncomfortable.,2,130
"I got two of the same shirt. The material is okay, just kind of heavy if you are using the shirts for working out",2,113
"The size ordered XXL is way too small, like the L in America",2,60
I couldnt fit a 1” tumble in the one I got. Terrible.,2,53
some of the earring arrived broken,2,34
"I wanted red sneakers. Despite the &#34;red rose&#34; color description, they are pink.  Wouldn't bother me normally, but I bought these for a Daniel Tiger costume and now I need to get other shoes....",2,201
I was so excited to get this for my mother I bought them in May and brought them to her today in the middle of June and they are dead already .  I’m going to go buy new batteries to see what happens next I should’ve read the reviews it doesn’t sound like I’m alone .,2,266
"Look at the size chart. I did that and got the right size, but when I tried it on it felt too bulky and made me look heavier. It's just not for me. Lots of people love this shirt, and the quality seemed fine, just don't buy it thinking it will be a thinner plaid.",2,263
"I have used it for a week, the zipper broke. The chemical smell is so strong! Wouldn’t recommend",2,96
Comes apart in a month or two from just wearing it to a desk job and not doing anything stressful,2,97
Length is way too short to wear as a dress.,2,43
Didn't fiit right,2,17
VERY WIDE!!!,2,12
Had to rush out and buy another gift when this one arrived in the mail!  Tiny earrings seem suitable for a child.,2,113
It looked cute but was a smaller. I ordered what it suggested but you should order at least 1 size up.,2,102
"Boot was nice and fit as expected. The description of the boot listed the material as leather with a man made sole. The entire boot is synthetic. Since I was looking for authentic leather, I returned them. The seller needs to accurately list the boots because the description is misleading.",2,290
Neckline was not sewed right.,2,29
This shoe is not sturdy and bends easily. My toddlers toes kept coming out the top when she would bend her foot.,2,112
"Super cute style but after 5 wears, maybe 3 washes the stitching is coming undone.",2,82
got it in January and fell in love at first sight. i began using it every day. but now its falling apart at the seams :( i love this bag but it didn't last long and it makes me super sad.,2,187
"Runs extremely small, more on thr junior side.",2,46
I am 5’10” and the straps are too short. Disappointed,2,53
Clasp doesn't have a tight lock. I wore it for the first time yesterday and lost the lava stone.  Unfortunately I will be returning it.  The chain scratches my neck and snagged my shirt.,2,186
Very confusing to get the right size.,2,37
It seems nice but with the wire it is really impractical.,2,57
The material is really thin,2,27
Cute but is better sized for a toddler. The color is a little off.,2,66
Order a size larger<br />The fabric is very thin and cheap<br />Does look nice but see through.,2,95
Sheds like no other.,2,20
Way to big for my neck on any link,2,34
Don't love it,2,13
"This thing is a tent and looked like I was wearing a pillowcase. That said, it was a very comfortable circus tent if that's what you're into.",2,141
THE BAD REVIEWS ARE RIGHT. Super cheap material. The fit was really weird. It flares at the waist but gets tighter at the bottom. Super not pleased.,2,148
"I really wanted to like this dress, but the pockets are sewn in so weirdly that it just doesn’t look right! I’m going to have to send it back. Such a bummer!",2,157
Waist band has very little elastic and I have to constantly pull them up.,2,73
Ordered these boxers because my husband likes longer legged boxers.  We took the boxers out of packaging and held them up and the legs were to short. In description it said 6 inches.  Maybe 3 inches not 6. Sent them back,2,220
Size didn't fit ...but if you are petite or for any small children it's a good choice...color was nice and the customer services are great,2,138
Too big 😩😩 need the smaller version of these,2,44
"I have bought so many of these, but the rainbow pair came with a hole in it.",2,76
"I was really hoping that this would work out... nope. I am petite, 5'3, 115 lbs. I ordered the medium and it was WAY to small still. Not for longer torsos, that's for sure. I returned and was going to reorder but decided against it because I wasn't sure if the rest of the outfit would fit correctly.",2,300
Didn't notice a difference..,2,28
They were not as comfortable as I thought they would be. Thanks,2,63
"I purchased these for my 3 yr old and they are too large and bulky for his hands, and don't stay on.  He doesn't like to wear them b/c they are awkward and fall off, so they were a waste of money.",2,196
"While it does look nice, when I see plush; I think ""thick and heavy.""<br /><br />This is neither.<br /><br />I ordered an XL, this fits more like a large.<br /><br />Not too impressed with this.",2,194
"I wouldn't consider buying these unless you have a size 5 foot, I wear a 10 and they don't work for me.<br />Apparently made in China, The packaging has Chinese lettering.",2,171
"Pretty cut,  however had a strange fit. Darts ending in points that didn't correspond with breasts. Trying to make adjustments didn't work.",2,139
Not happy that the pictures shows multiple cats but the description says you get one RANDOM cat very misleading and NOT worth the price.,2,136
I wasn't crazy about it. Some threads were loose also. I returned it. :(,2,72
"Bought two, used one two times and it started to rip. I guess this one of those you get what you pay for. Look at photo. If your in a budget and not gonna use that often it may work for you.",2,190
The dress itself was fine but this dress is not made for larger busts. I wear a 32K and have a 10+ inch difference between bust and waist and this did not fit at all. I ordered according to size chart. I'm shocked it's worked so well for others - maybe quality control is the problem?,2,284
"The dress was too large and not at all flattering, not on me at least. The material is uncomfortable.",2,101
It turned my finger green after the third use and it was such a weird shape.,2,76
Looked very good at the beginning. Broke at the buckle after 2 months.<br />Would like to replace it.,2,101
Somewhat small and the armpit holes are weird.,2,46
This garment fit as expected but it doesn’t Firm up the area I was buying it for. I have stubborn back fat that shows in my dresses. It stills how’s when I put this shaper on. What a waste of my money.,2,201
Yellow green dial which is not attractive.  Looks and feels very cheap.  Sent it back.,2,86
"It is a good thing I plan on using this dress as a shirt because the picture is deceiving, I will be lucky that it covers my buttocks",2,133
After wearing these for a few weeks the top part started to peel off. I tried to glue it back but it’s not holding and just getting worse. Aside from that I do like that they are easy for my 4 year old to put on himself and comfortable.,2,236
I am tall so it was not long enough,2,35
"Beautiful,  but not a good quality.  I got it for my sister and first day one of the charms came off.  😕",2,104
"Day 1, already starting to tarnish",2,34
"I thought it would have been heavier, even though it wasn't silver but it felt very ""weak"". It's pretty and all but not a sturdy piece of jewelry.",2,146
"The size is smaller then mentioned in the chart!<br /><br />Size US Medium Order Date: December 3, 2017",2,103
Women's fit t-shirt. I ordered 3xl and it was too small. I usually wear 2xl. Too short and too tight.,2,101
"Cute but VERY see-through. You couldn't use it to swim in, only as a top or costume piece or something.  Wish there was a higher q suit with the print!",2,151
Made out of a thin cheap material. Fits oddly on your head. Cheap construction.,2,79
"Kept great time - until 2 days after Amazon return period 1 of the ""ears"" fell off (where the pin holds the band on). Contacted Casio, received reply, but then nothing for over a week. For the price, not worth pursuing for a replacement. Buy cheap, get cheap.",2,259
This is so small it looks like a child's size. Not what the picture represents. Shorter then shown also. Very disappointed but this one example you get what you pay for.,2,169
I like the dress but I'm going to have to hem it myself.,2,56
Fit is great but material is not so good. Corners of the skort curl up - which defeats the style of this skort.,2,111
The eyes are in the wrong position. Will change my review if new mask is sent,2,77
"Looks great but material that flaps down rolls up showing underside of fabric, doesn’t make it verybattractive",2,110
The band has to be synched very tight to prevent the buckle from raising up and not seating.  If you don't then it catches on things because it's protruding so much.,2,165
Demasiado grande no me gustó,2,28
Did not fit as advertised.,2,26
Ordered my size it fit snug. Didn't realize it had a hood. Just wasn't overly impressed.,2,88
"Pros- fit, grip, fingerless option, price<br /><br />Major Con- NO GEL CUSHION AT ALL. The ‘gel’ is dots placed on the heel of the glove for grip NOT FOR CUSION OR COMFORT OR IMPACT. These would be better suited for work out gloves NOT for bicycle riding",2,254
this dress overall is a cute dress however the fabric is quite thin. the top of the dress is way to loose.,2,106
The fit isn't wasn't I expected... It's too tight around my neck and the clasp is very hard to do up.,2,101
felt cheap,2,10
im only giving it a 2 because the fabric is in shape and it's still in one piece but i ordered it in a small and got a large!,2,125
They fit well but the color of them looks faded. I thought they were all black,2,78
Thought quality would be better. True to size though.,2,53
fit me small was upset. i have thick hips.,2,42
Unfortunately... this was much too bulky for me.  I was looking for something to use as a concealed carry.  I still plan to use with my range bag... but... it's just not what I hoped for.,2,187
I ordered rose but item came as dirty gold with several stones missing. Very poor quality. Not happy with item,2,110
It is too big can I exchange this for a small?,2,46
It runs large!,2,14
Very stiff and scratchy fabric,2,30
This sweatshirt runs super small. An Adult small would fit like an xxs. Buy a much bigger size.,2,95
I did like the pants but I very disappointed they don’t fit. You don’t have the right size.,2,91
So thin and the material had balling on it right out package … they are not soft or nice feeling at all. Very cheap,2,115
"Too small overall and too short in length.  Fabric is not standard cotton looking, but synthetic type.  I am 5’8” about 160 and ordered ‘L’.",2,140
I'm 5'9 and this dress came down to about 2-3 inches above my ankles. It also doesn't look too good once it's on.,2,113
One side was upper one side was down. Curves are asymmetrical.,2,62
Great idea poor result . Returned it.,2,37
Not true to size. Way too small,2,31
Will be returning these - they run way too small.,2,49
the socks are too small and too short. unwearable.,2,50
This dress was very cute but ran very small in the arms and the sleeves were short. I was very disappointed with the fit.,2,121
"Cute, but not for me! I’m 5’7”, 110lbs and I felt like I was drowning in it, even it being a Small. Red is way brighter than pictured, being more like the shade of a cheap lipstick rather than a pretty tomato red. I’ll be returning this for sure!",2,246
i bought this legging because i loved the design. when i tried it on it felt ok. but when i put it to work out and starts sweating. it feels sticky and feels like it doesn't let my skin breath. and i really dislike that feeling.,2,228
"The Packers emblem literally wore off in less than 10 days. And although I registered for the warranty, the company wanted me to jump through hoops for a replacement. Won’t purchase again.",2,188
"Fits weird. Maybe it’s my body type. Top was too large and bottoms are short. I have very large boobs so, read measurements and hope for the best",2,145
"Sorry,  but I live in the desert and need more than this to feel cool or even cooler,  especially in the summer",2,111
The tank top is wide at the bottom and short in the torso. The logo print is cute but it still sits in my draw because of the awkward fit.,2,138
I should have read the dimensions before I ordered these. They're long and narrow. I wanted them to put produce scraps in. I have to use a 1 quart soup container. Ordering bigger wider ones for next time.,2,204
"Liked the idea of this band, but it was way too tight when put on, wished was a little longer and had more available holes.",2,123
"They are cute but very loose, they don’t shrink in the dryer either",2,67
The fabric is not regular swim suit fabric. It's way smaller than expected and it's more a neon purple than the deep purple in the picture. There is a reason it is so cheap! Buyer beware,2,186
I really liked the look of the sunglasses but they were so bent- frames and ear pieces that I could not wear them and returned them.  Bummed.,2,141
"As cute as it is you need to order a size up, and it still looks funny since I have a smaller chest. Probably won't ever wear it since it fits so awkwardly",2,155
Because the shapes are the same on the longer earrings one goes up the ear and the other goes down the ear.,2,107
The ring in the photograph is nothing like the ring received. Very disappointed and contacted the seller,2,104
"Cheap plastic attached to the mask, it gets foggy. No good!",2,59
"Having tried several pairs of compression socks, i find these lacking. They were not entirely true to size. The toe area was too small as well as the heel area. The socks did not cover all the way to the knee",2,208
"It was okay, but, didn't fit to good,. I'm plus size, and I could never get the right size for me, also very uncomfortable.  I sent back,. and didn't want another one",2,166
The clasp on the wrist watch band is very poorly made.  The watch fell off my wrist about 30 seconds after I put it on. Have returned the watch.,2,144
The ends flop all over and knots don't stay in place,2,52
I didn't realize how big this was. I think this would be better for a man. I wanted something a little smaller.,2,111
Runs small. I had a very disappointed daughter at Christmas. She’s thin...it should have fit 😔,2,94
Do not buy this watch. It is adjustable but as soon as you put it on the clamp moves and the watch does not fit snugly on your wrist. The band looks nice but it is a big disappointment.,2,185
The material is so thin,2,23
Runs small I normally wear a large I ordered extra large and it was really tight,2,80
"I was unable to wear the hat because the ""pocket"" wasn't deep enough. I wear a normal size hat even with my hair as it is a short pixie. The satin inside is nice and it is nice to have the adjustable strap, if only i could keep it on my head!",2,242
"It's very pretty, but my long hair gets caught near the clasp every time.",2,73
"Item is not very well made. It's in my hand for 3 minutes and the valve is already half falling out. Also, not very breathable at all. Glasses still fog up.",2,156
too big  and thick stem for the ear holes,2,41
"I love the style and the look, but upon arrival the post was bent completely sideways from shipment.",2,100
Paint came off after a couple days and irritated my nose. It's  too bad because they are super cute,2,99
"The bags are definitely smaller than expected, not a lot of width either",2,72
I did not order this statue.  It was a bracelet..,2,49
The earrings are so thick they will never be able to to be worn...had to return. They are lightweight and pretty...if your piercing is very open these may work.,2,160
"The necklace is fabric, and it separated from the clasp after wearing only a few times.  I sent it back.  I must say that Amazon was very good about accepting the return.",2,170
"The product description reads ""Made of top genuine leather braided with stainless steel metal clasp"".  The bracelet turned my wrist green the 1st day I wore it. I wear stainless steel jewelry regularly and it NEVER turns my skin green.",2,235
Poorly made. Cheap,2,18
The dress is cute but very long.  It is also very thin so it’s really see through.,2,82
Not very sturdy,2,15
Smallll,2,7
These bands are cheaply made. The plastic pieces that adjust the bands to size are flimsy and don’t stay in place- I have to adjust them back several times a day as it loosens,2,175
Very small pocket,2,17
"Cute shoe, but runs very small and narrow. I tried the next size up and it was still way too small.",2,99
These bras are nice to look at but they have a nipple formed in the front so when you use a thin blouse you can see is image.,2,125
"ADULT size, these fit my husband (who has a big head) WAY too big for my 9 year old.",2,84
"I needed an electronic travel organizer, thought this would work. it is basically a piece of cardboard with flex straps, trying to add all my gadgets didn't work because of the various sizes of the straps.  Ended up buying a travel bag organizer that works and covers all my gadgets.",2,283
"I thought these would be great for our employees that always have to carry a lot of key, unfortunately the clasp tends to unscrew and you end up dropping the keys on the floor.",2,176
"Sizing is kind of off, this was too small and I normally wear a XL.  Also be warned this is very very see through.",2,114
Pilling is awful.,2,17
Size is snug,2,12
"Ok for the price, but definitely look like old lady glasses.",2,60
Returned Looked faded,2,21
Unfortunately they were too small for my face. I was so heartbroken. My daughter was able to use them.,2,102
"Super see through, had to return it",2,35
"Nice fit, but the material is not dry fit.",2,42
To heavy to wear in Florida !,2,29
Did not like top design and transparency of the back of top.,2,60
Cute but big,2,12
"Ordered 2 sets, they didn't come separately packaged together. All different sizes. Only 1 pair of 5 fit my feet. They are definitely NOT nonslip. The other &#34;set&#34; were gifts for my sister. She has smaller feet, size 7 vs my size 8...I haven't heard if they fit.",2,269
"The print is horrible - it's like a photo blown up and the pixels have faded. The style of the dress is nice - fit's ok. I'm 5'7, 118lbs.  Not a fan - and cheap polyester fabric  Returning.",2,189
One of the bags was open and gloves were missing..they are too short in the wrist and once washed I am worried they will shrink further.. returning them,2,152
The largest one busted as I was packing it.  The other two cubes worked ok.  Not as strong as others that are the same price.,2,125
"the nasal bridge on the mask sticks out like a bird's beak, hard to tell from the product photo",2,95
"I didn’t like the fact that you could see the stitching on the arm. It’s not that tight, and it don’t compress. I’m 5 “7” 1/2...150 lbs. I ordered a medium. Sleeve could’ve been longer and the shirt could’ve been tighter. I returned this item.",2,243
"A couple of the pins that hold the strap on the watch were smaller than others. I had to swap pins from one strap to get it to stay on the watch face. Thankfully I only intend to use one color, otherwise I'd be out of luck. Don't buy this garbage.",2,247
Came with a fold in the print which sucked.,2,43
"The size is accurate and it looks like the pictures but I just can’t stand the material. It doesn’t feel terrible to touch so i was tricked into wearing it, but the entire time I had it on I couldn’t wait to take it off bc it was so thick and way too hot.",2,255
It looks fine but I've had it for some months and it doesn't keep the best time--I already lost one link---,2,107
The pants tore before I could even wear them. They were super comfy other than that.,2,84
The color and material were not what I expected. Its rather cheaply made  and small in the arms.,2,96
Not at all what you expect. the gold thing in front is not a necklace like i thought it was. Its a zipper. Had I known that was a zipper I wouldnt have bought it.,2,162
The black on the fabric looks faded (like washed many times). I did not like that. It is sad because everything else is fine. I use it to be at home.,2,149
Way too large. Could not use on recent cruise and can not send it back.,2,71
It was really warm but the sleeves were too short and the shoulders didn’t fit. For reference I am 5’10” 150 pounds and I bought the large. Sadly I had to return it,2,164
The sunglasses look great and stylish. The polarized lenses aren't great.,2,73
only thing i did not like about these are they were too magnified under water. made me dizzy. almost like wearing perscription glasses that are too strong for you.,2,163
Dress too short. Goes above the knee,2,36
I liked the boot but it came ripped so I returned it.,2,53
"They are very soft, but not really warm and some pairs left fuzzies everywhere",2,78
quality is so bad. had to return!,2,33
Very pretty when I first opened it but it tarnished after 2 days.,2,65
The adjustable cord did not work! The wolf was smaller than portrayed in photo!  A gift for my husband and first time I got something from Amazon and was disappointed !,2,168
The fit of the top was great and the skirt was nice for showing your figure but the color was not what I expected. Returned,2,123
They only look good on one side. I didn't realize the pattern was only on one side.,2,83
"Its great material. However the bottom, supposedly a medium is very very big..",2,78
Rose gold turned yellow pretty quick.,2,37
Dress is great material and all but runs super small.,2,53
"Item is not true to size.  I wear Large or XL, and I ordered XL just to be safe, but it can't be larger than a small or medium in size.  Sweater doesn't wrap around to the front at all.",2,185
"I adored this ring when I got it...but already 2 small stones fell out...was gonna just order another, but no.  wont do that again...im sad about this....I get my nails done and my rings are on social media A LOT...this one wont be again.",2,238
Much lighter than navy blue. Shallow pockets and hood. Buttons we're very loose.,2,80
Nice feel of the material and color.  Runs small.,2,49
"Not flattering at all on larger ladies. The print is lovely, but the dress has no form and the belt isn't enough to save it.",2,124
"Typically I wear a medium, but go with a large for extra sleeve length. This shirt is TIGHT in a large. Not to mention there is no shape to the shirt. The sleeves go past my elbows but not where near as long as the picture leads us to believe. I would recommend passing on this item.",2,283
I usually wear a medium/large but mostly large and I got a small in this,2,72
it fits really weird. it is too long and it definitely came in a size way too small and i even got a size bigger then i usually do. my breasts barely fit in it.,2,160
"I love the look and weight of this belt and its perfect for work, but its way too small.  There's no way the xl is an actual xl.",2,128
Missing 1 bead,2,14
Broke 14  months from putting them in my Rocky boots.  cannot handle the military speed lace setup,2,98
"This product fits poorly, is not true to size.",2,46
"3 out of the 5 masks had the metal piece that goes across your nose at the bottom of the mask, by the chin. I ordered these masks because of the cool graphics and also for the metal nose piece. I can't wear those 3 masks with my glasses. Disappointing",2,251
Sizing was extremely off from other jeans.,2,42
"The top portion fits really weird. It looks like it should cover your chest, but it just kind of sits at the top of it. It's a very weird-looking and very uncomfortable fit. I don't think I'll be wearing it.",2,207
These are not polarized and do a poor job at blocking the sun.,2,62
Tks.,2,4
Masks is too small.  Looks like made for a child,2,48
Item arrived as described,2,25
Too short. It's a knee length. Not like shown in the picture. And it's a very see through.,2,90
"Very small, I’m not sure I can wear it. The headband hurts my head.",2,67
Sleeves were longer than previous Hugo Boss suits. I ended up sending it back.,2,78
Bought a size bigger than I normally wear and it's still too small,2,66
"Its a cute blouse and a nice color. I am usually a medium but ordered a large because of the reviews and it was still small. The material kinda stuck to me, too.",2,161
Cute top but the fabric became fuzzy from my purse strap. I’ve never had a top do this before. A shame because it’s noticeable and was only worn one time. Kind of a waste of money.,2,180
They weren't anything special - just normal sunglasses.  No different from any I could have gotten from the drug store...,2,121
"It's a cute earring but everything in the add says post length is 6mm, the one they sent me is 8mm. Too long doesn't work for my peircing.",2,138
"not as nice as expected. Un hemmed bottom edge, raw fabric edge.",2,64
They're too wide and don't fit on my head.,2,42
Took almost two MONTHS to receive these shoes. Have had them about a week and some of the lights are already out.,2,113
Odd fit,2,7
"I ordered white and was shipped off-white for the 2nd time.  The arms are very tight, but I'm on a pretty tight deadline and will have to make it work.",2,151
"Too tight across chest, going back",2,34
Very inexpensive so that's good but feels super cheap and flimsy. Better off getting a $50 Walmart watch.,2,105
"Pretty, but definitely fake. The beads are “polished” but are totally plastic and not baltic amber. You can tell by the beads if you look at them there is no  pitch or resin in them like genuine amber beads. Also they are weightless and float.  Very bummed.",2,257
Runs a size smaller or two depending<br />But I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I'm going to keep it even though I'm not happy,2,149
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP73D5M/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3,2,64
It is really small and the charm broke the first day I used it. The inside image fell out of the metal circle. I’m going to try gorilla glue to fix it.,2,151
"The design was a little modest, but decent looking, but the fabric felt and looked cheap - closer to vinyl than a cotton. It came too late for the formal event I was going to wear it to, but I returned it anyway because of how cheap it seemed.",2,243
Buy a size bigger than you normally would. Very tight in the arms!,2,66
I ordered a small. Quality is decent but it is at least a foot longer than small would normally be. I would say a small in this belt would fit a person with a 40-in waist.,2,171
"i am 5'3&#34;, 110 lbs, 34C, and the cups were way too high for me.  I have a slightly shorter than average torso and I think this bathing suit is better for long torso people.",2,176
Just cheep,2,10
The little nuts that hold the screws come off so easily and you do not notice until your lenses fall off. I was very disappointed on how little these glasses lasted.,2,165
Not the same color as my rose gold watch. I was disappointed it looked a little cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.,2,120
"this has a thick elastic waist band that gathers all the extra material and leaves it very unflattering around the front below the waist. Maybe it'd look better on someone shorter, but the bottom part will be baggy.",2,215
"The dangle part in the back overwhelms the cross.  And since the cross part is on a hook, I can't even tuck the dangle part into another hole. Oh, and they do to off. Not worth the price.",2,187
"Color was good, softness medium, fit way too small even tho I ordered large",2,75
It was not what i expected not made like it looks,2,49
Way too big for me!,2,19
Sharper edges than one I previously bought. Could potentially cut your wrist if it got caught on something. Cute but have to be careful.,2,136
they are to costumey and way to big,2,35
These are shiny lycra...completely non professional for a work environment- more like workout wear.  Wish I would have known,2,124
It turned colors,2,16
"The hat is big enough for me to wear. There is no real separation from the brim and the cap, so the brim wraps tightly around my head and face and stops at my chin. I bought this for a two year old!<br />2 stars for the laughs.",2,227
Dress was very cheaply made and thin material. Will be returning.,2,65
Super cute...but the rhinestones started falling off just one week after having them.,2,85
"Item is described as being decorated by &#34;top quality leather&#34;.  What is more accurate is that it has PU Leather, which IS NOT leather at all. PU Leather is a synthetic MAN MADE material. Pleather is more accurate. I will be returning these.",2,248
I received it defected and had to send it back. But even if it was all right it still had some issues - you can't see in it and can't properly breath. The company needs to work on design and comfort of use.,2,206
The front is wrapped like a skort. Not what it looked like to me in the picture.,2,80
"not good, legs of classes are easy to break",2,43
"Dress is ok. It wasnt as thick as I expected but its not see through. I'm 5'4"" and it's pretty long on me, longer than I wanted.",2,128
I received a totally different pair of glasses,2,46
It nice .,2,9
Terrible fitting and hard to put on and tie up.,2,47
This mask is very thin and doesn’t stay in place. Poor quality.,2,63
So much pilling only after wearing for couple of hours ...,2,58
I like the gown however it runs small in size!,2,46
"If it twisted slightly on my wrist, it would easy unlock the mechanism and I'd lose my watch EVERYWHERE. At least 5-10 times a day.... it even fell into a toilet. So I went back to the original, plain black band, and I have not had it fall off once.",2,249
these are toys.  only about half actually worked at all.  Did not have high expectatons but at least thought that most of them would be functional when brand new.  The metal of the ring was not broke but the mood rock did not change colors.,2,240
Was fine until it snapped on the third day of wearing it,2,56
The Velcro to hold the mittens open came off after the first wear,2,65
Got a small and it looks like a garbage bag on me. The model is smaller than me so I’m not sure how it looks so fitted on her.,2,126
Is not a good fit and not good quality either,2,45
"The hubby was impressed when he initially tried them on, the fit was prefect. However, after the wash they never fit properly in the foot area - saggy. The hubby wears them mostly for the stabilization of the calf muscle, he said that he prefers his calf compression sleeves.",2,275
The seems were coming undone,2,28
Was hoping this product would fit...just a bit snug. Go with a size or two bigger.,2,82
its not verry well made and was a lighter color than what was pictured,2,70
"It i s a sock made into a mask, the sick bands are the ear loops. It is very hot and uncomfortable. It is not of for anyone that has sensitive skin.",2,148
Can’t get open to put pearls in,2,31
It's wearable but it stretches out over your fleshy parts and it grabs your belly and places you don't want it to,2,113
The scrubs are made of low quality materials. My kiddo ripped her pants within the first hour of playing. The accessories we received also do not match the ones listed and are falling apart as well.,2,198
"The Googlies fell out almost immediately. Until then, they were hilarious.",2,74
Love the charms but didn’t receive a single Virgo in the entire pack,2,68
"It’s a great band, but false advertisement. All photos show the band with a buckle and they don’t have buckles...they have snap in bands. They should show exactly what you are buying.",2,183
Very see thru.  Not sturdy material at all.,2,43
After reading the mixed reviews I think I might be sending my order back or canceling my order.. I'm 5'8&#34; and Im going to need my skirt to be floor length almost ball gown length.  Im not looking for a ankle granny skirt!,2,225
"Came in a nice package but missing the keychain, instead of the keychain it was a random bracelet. Sucks because it's a cute necklace :(",2,136
"Cheaply made for the money. They look fine but feel like a cheap plush toy. Not much stretch to them, fit is a little tight.",2,124
Like everyone said...which i missed before ordering its so uneven and on top of that mine came all bent in a weird way highly disappointed,2,138
Made Cheaply the button fell off after having it for 10 minute. But can’t complain it was only 20$,2,98
Shoe laces came in completely wrong...too large and too wide.,2,61
"They don't stay lit.  They are hard to turn on.  They don't go on your figers very well.  I guess as a party gag they are OK, but don't buy them if you are depending on them to light anything.",2,192
Too loose. The material it too thick and that makes it look low quality. Such a shame since the cut is very nice.,2,113
These are so small that they appear to have been made for a 6 or 7 year old.  Very disappointed.,2,96
Dress is not at all as pictured. Totally different style and color.,2,67
"It didn’t meet my expectations, I thought it was a box chain but it is not.",2,75
"Much brighter than pictured. The colors look like they could glow in the dark, especially the orange. Good sturdy cotton and design.",2,132
Love that my toddler says it’s comfy and fits good. The face just doesn’t look like Rob Gronkowski! Other then that…. a great shirt!,2,132
It is really cute but....I got what I paid for.  Zipper broke before the trip.  Used a luggage strap to be sure it didn't open while going through the airport.  Can really only be used as a carry on ... I would be concerned even with a gate check!  Use is for car travel and enjoy its cuteness.,2,294
"Was too small for my wrist, but looked as described.",2,52
Doesn't fit correctly. Cheaply made and a little lage in width.,2,63
These are HUGE. Made well but am a small person. Entered 1 1/2&#34; earrings & these popped up. I should have read more carefully. Sent an email to seller to try to return them but no response.,2,193
"I was hoping these shorts would be soft, but they are very very stiff.  Overall they are made well, and have very nice pockets, but they may be the stiffest shorts I have ever felt.  And, since they have teflon treatment on them, they don't soften with washing.",2,261
"I was excited to get these, but they have a shelf bra.  No where in the ad does it say they have a shelf bra.  I returned them because of this.  I think this is valuable info for the product.  I did get a free return, so that was nice.",2,235
The stitching is horrible and coming loose and hemmed out after barely a month.,2,79
Material is thin and see through,2,32
Received all crushed up into pieces did return & received a new one very soon but tarnished after awhile. You get what you pay for.,2,131
"It won't stay on my shoulders, and is wide through the waist, with arms that are just slightly too short.",2,105
I wish I knew it ran big. It looks like a sack on me. I wish it was smaller or it was in the description. I love the color of the dress.,2,136
"Not happy with this purchase as the colors & type doesn't match the picture,,,I will keep to sleep in but can't use what we wanted for because the red is not red it's a maroon & the blue is a purplish & the neon had a small hole so no not happy with purchase",2,258
I don't like this dress,2,23
They don’t warm your feet at all!! I wear em cause I work outdoors. My feet are never warm. They’re just another pair of designer socks. I was fooled. Don’t be a sucker like me.,2,177
"This dress is do disproportionate.  The top is snug but the bottom almost has too much flare. But the worst issue is the material. It's like a stiff, brocade type stuff. It reminds me of old, thickly lined curtains from the 70s. Won't ever wear it-going in the yard sale bag.",2,275
Didn’t look as nice as the picture but I put a belt on it and for the price it was worth it,2,91
"It's like pictured, but the material is super cheap.  I might return.",2,69
"Just received the anklet.  It fits with no room to spare and I have average size ankles.  I bought it for my granddaughter and her ankles are larger so I'm sure it won't work for her.  Also, the extension doesn't look very strong.  Not as nice as I hoped it would be.  Paula LoFranco",2,283
They aren’t that cute in person and they look so cheap and quality is not as good as it claims,2,94
Works for a handful of uses then the teeth bend off and the product is useless. Get shirt stays from an Army Navy store or other military surplus place.,2,152
It's isn't as red as I expected; more burgundy. And also very thin material.,2,76
This was the weirdest material. I never ended up wearing it despite liking the style and fit. It was basically the material of a stretch outdoor table cloth. I guess at least it was spill resistant?,2,198
"These would be so much nicer if they were smaller, too big!",2,59
Mask is great . but scrunchie sucks no elastic or the elastic was bad . so very dissatisfied.,2,93
"Cute for sure but definitely not gold plated. Won’t last long. If you buy, have the expectation that it’s a temporary thing.",2,124
Okay fit for lounging around the house but they are too tight around the glutes when active.,2,92
The grr pants fit mush differently than the black ones A not the same type of loose material and feel like a size smaller ☹️,2,124
Cute and comfortable but it shrank two sizes during its first laundering. Very disappointed.,2,92
Dislike because the clip-on wires won't let the glasses rest on the right place.,2,80
Muy largo,2,9
These pjs are super cute but very ill fitting. I bought a size 5 for a 4 year old and had to return them because they fit supper skinny and tight.,2,146
Me llego la camisa blanca manchada.,2,35
"The bag is very cute and looks nice, but after just a couple of uses the zipper came apart.",2,91
Cheaply made - not pleased,2,26
"Some reviews stated the color of the lens blue, some stated it was grey. The pair I got the lens is grey on the edges of the lens and the bifocal, the rest of the lens has a yellow tint to it. I was looking for grey not yellow.",2,227
"These look completely different from the pictures. When I opened the box I was immediately disappointed. They look very cheaply made, almost to the point of having come out of a gumball machine.",2,194
"I bought these for my son, they are slightly smaller and of less quality than those I have ordered from Hanes in the past.  I was disappointed in the quality and fit, keeping them as back up boxers rather than go through the hassle of sending them back.",2,253
Did not realize flag is one sided. Seems silly to have it read backwards from one side.,2,87
This is definitely not long. Its the length of a normal T-shirt so it isn't great for leggings. Super disappointed. I would've given it 4 stars if it were as described.,2,168
This was way too short on my 11 year old daughter who wears a kids 14. Ordered her a xs since it was women's and it was so short on her.,2,136
The slit was way higher and the fabric was too thin. Return.,2,60
Giving it two stars because I love how the top fits and looks. Unfortunately the bottoms were completely see thru and were sewed oddly at the waist. Will be wearing the top out though!,2,184
wasnt what i expected from description ended sending it back and getting another robe. Quality was so-so and was too short for me,2,129
Works and fits over my wrist. The blue started scratching off from the magnet after the first use though. It’s silver under the blue paint.,2,139
"Color was totally off, and the elbow part is off as well",2,56
"One wash or one dip in water and fabric will be kaput. A tan ONLY bikini~no activities will be done in this one! Kept it bc it's kindaaa cute, bottoms are skimpy af. Typical cheap bikini *shrugs*",2,195
"Way too tight around the bust. I normally where a medium, but this medium just did not fit. Pretty dress though. Returned it.",2,125
Thin and the clasps on the neck strap are very cheap. Two of the clasps caved in when I tried to snap them together. So now I can't clasp them together which makes it useless! Very frustrating!,2,193
"cheaply made, and the gold color lace doesn't match the same color as the chains",2,80
Didn't do much for me for my night vision.  Ok construction.,2,60
Not as nice as the competitor ones...No folding guide. It wasn't worth the discounted price. Returned.,2,102
"Odd Fit, not worth the price",2,28
This wallet is much too small for U.S. currency and quite slick to handle. Hubby complained every time he tried to remove from his pocket that it was slick/slippery making it hard to pull from pants pockets.,2,207
these are not for a regular pandora braclet,2,43
Order a size larger,2,19
Very rough feeling fabric,2,25
Very confusing to put on and took a long time. Doesn't turn out like the picture,2,80
Wayyyyy toooooo smalllll,2,24
Dislike the entire watch!,2,25
Low quality wore it for maybe a month before it changed colors and broke both of them,2,85
The circle part is larger and the A is smaller then I expected.,2,63
Jab the inside of the nose should be more L Shapped.,2,52
I bought this for my 6 year old. It is too heavy and fits akward. Waste of money,2,80
It is pretty but very small for a 4xl. The bust area inserted pads move around. You get what you pay for. Cheap,2,111
"Too tight, pockets are so shallow that they are totally useless. Cheap feel.",2,76
"These gloves are comfortable, but disappointed in the color.  It is not a gray or a true brown.  I wanted more of a Neutral or calfskin light beige color glove, as shown in the picture.  Not impressed with the color as not as shown.",2,232
"Unfortunately I had to return these. I bought my normal size and I could barely even pull them up, they were so tight. Order a size bigger for sure. But, even then, I felt the waist was unusually small and tight.",2,212
Arrived broken,2,14
Stones were loose in the package! Unsusable.,2,44
"Do not get. It is most definitely a bootleg product. On one of the buttons, the Pokemon battle theme started playing. Its only 18 dollars and it arrived on time, so at the very least it has that.",2,195
Did not fit well on my feet when I walked,2,41
Cute but was much smaller then expected,2,39
"Way too small. My 11 yr old normally wears a 12/14 in PJ bottoms. These fleece pants are so short that the size 16/18 is even too short on him...did I mention hes only 11, and hes average size.",2,193
"Wierd fit, but super comfy for around the house with leggings.  The sleeves are short and the bottom is very wide and doesn’t flow well",2,135
Bought XL which is my usual size. Way too small. Stretched ok but looked awful when on. Very sheer too. Returned them.,2,118
"Feels cheap, and only makes things look yellow. No improvement in clarity for me. See the same, but no yellowing, without them.",2,127
"Returned. Too small in the top, but bottom fit pretty well. not great construction or material but that was to be expected considering the price. the leg holes were too tight, but it was a little loose in the waist.",2,215
"Not really a favorite buy.  It's okay, but nothing exciting.",2,60
"dress looks cheap, not sure the clasp on the back would last long. returned",2,75
Returned,2,8
I love everything about this dress... except the super weird pleat right in the front over the belly button. Accentuates the worst part of a mama's body and just looks strange. Rest of the dress is great though. Will be returning...,2,232
Not a fan of shorts that have the underwear In them. Personal preference,2,72
"This is a super sweet dress, BUT I am a huge cotton supporter. I never purchase clothes that have polyester in them. The description of this dress says 100% cotton, so untrue!!!  And I purchased for a baby shower gift!!! So unhappy right now.",2,242
The seams on this shirt were sewn very poorly so the shoulders aren’t smooth.,2,77
"Really nice hat but way too small. Must be nice for women or children, not big men,",2,83
"I'm so sad that this jacket did not fit, my husband was so excited when he opened his Christmas gift, only to be disappointed when it did not fit. I ordered an XL which fit like a medium.",2,187
Arms too long length of shirt too short,2,39
"Bough a 2nd pair, thought maybe the first pair was defective.  Seems to be a design flaw, though.  The sole squeaks loudly with every step.  Wast of hard earned money.  Big disappointment, they are comfortable, too!",2,215
The waist band is very comfortable. Thats where the good stops. There is a large seam that runs right up the backside. Its not even flat stitched. It gives you a permenant wedgie. The legs bunch up almost instantly,2,214
Must be a Chinese knock off. The quality was very poor. The black strips on the sleeves peeled off after the first use. Not even washed it.,2,139
I have only worn them twice.  Thought about returning them.  The heal area is extremely hard and painful to walk on.,2,116
"I was expecting a watch with a black face, as shown on this picture and in the ad.  The watch has a white face that has a whole different look.",2,143
"So thin, I was afraid it might break just touching it...",2,56
It's ok for price but not high quality material. The belt buckle broke after being worn 3xs!,2,92
the sizing was not what I expected. It was not slouchy like I wanted. Had to give it away. I would avoid this manufacturer.,2,123
Arrived in bout 5 days. Scarf on pic is much prettier color is much deeper. I really wanted this Christmas scarf for the up coming holiday of 2016. I will still wear but it won't have the pop I was expecting.,2,208
"The hat may have the features listed, however it does not look like the picture on Amazon. It is actually an aluminum foil type look on both the front and back. Not going to keep this one.",2,188
Size of the star is not the correct size in proportion to the blue field.,2,73
Its not at all like the picture. It keeps me warm thats about it,2,64
These things broke in the first day.,2,36
It is very small,2,16
Bought this coat for my 2yr old daughter in a size 3T at first but it was too big so I replaced it for 2T and it’s still too big. The size says XL instead of 2T.,2,161
We haven't even had the shoes a month and now they won't charge. Not happy.  He wanted to wear them for the 4th and now they wont even light up.,2,144
Love everything about it.,2,25
"way too small, it would fit a little kid not an adult",2,53
Didn't fit and were returned.,2,29
"Shirt is nice, but up close looks very cheap... Very very cheap.. Cheaper than Walmart.... I'm a built 5,8 180lbs bee muscular and my arms wouldn't fit.. My forearms barely fit.. Order one or 2 sizes up",2,202
Gave to my daughter.  Short and wide. Not completely white more off—white.,2,74
I returned the first 2 purchased because they had a small stain. One of the shirts in the replacement has a stain in the same place as the first 2. The shirts a very white so they show every imperfection. I intend to keep the replacements and wear them under another shirt,2,272
cheap and broken parts.,2,23
"Not durable. Already had a hole after one use!<br />Comfortable.<br />As it is not durable, it is not good value for money.<br />Can this be refunded?",2,150
Product is not what I expected. I was looking for hard  leather case.,2,69
It’s too large for me,2,21
"Product was not as big as I would have liked. They are heavy, and extremely hard to put on. I am giving them to a friend who can use them and liked them. I will try again and purchase a larger size. Overall, it is a good product, well made.",2,240
"I wore them twice and one earring broke while taking them out of my ear.  They are very pretty, but didn't last long.",2,117
The shirt and shorts color dont match. Shirt looks faded,2,56
It’s an ok dress but cheap material. Had a hole in it after first wear,2,70
itchy.,2,6
"It tore to easy, hard to slide packs in and out, maybe i should have gotten two sizes bigger but I'm a 2x. It was too short and a bit tight.",2,140
The logo was at the bottom of the shirt and was very baggy.,2,59
easy wear out,2,13
"Definitely not true to size. Top is supposed to be a 36b, fits more like a 34a. Bottoms supposed to be large, fits like a small.",2,128
"They fit just fine. My issue is the odor on them. Smells strongly like fuel and doesn't wash out, I've tried vinegar with essential oil and baking soda with no luck.",2,165
Fabric is still very stiff after several washings. Color fades after first wash and I used a cold water wash. All in all not a good buy when you take the expensive shipping into account.,2,186
It's not the same color. And it's to big than expected. Btw i use it like a sleeping dress,2,90
This seems to run a bit small. The quality seems decent otherwise.,2,66
"Cute but paper thin, came wrinkled and I didn’t want to take a chance with ironing so I ultimately sent it back",2,111
"This dress had potential but didn’t make the mark for me. The top is bulky, and while the bottom front is flattering, the back is really thin. Also, my product came with two food stains on it. So I’ll be returning.",2,214
"This product is advertised as “padded” but the entire bra was extremely thin and there was no padding. This bra offers no support, but good coverage.<br />Quality was somewhat cheap and the bra was not comfortable to wear.",2,222
"the shoe inserts came apart.  It seems as though the glue is not up to par.  I would prefer buying a more expensive, better quality product but not have it fall apart on me.  I will have to re-purchase something else next summertime for sure.",2,242
"I'm really disappointed. These are incredibly hard to open and close, and these definitely are not a standard 16g. It was too big to fit into my piercing; my nose screw which is a 16g actually fit inside the end of the hinge.",2,225
"Maybe it's just me, but I found this strap uncomfortable to wear. My chin was so stressed when I wore it that I could not get to sleep unless I remove it so I decided not to use it anymore",2,188
Seam on pants came apart before he even got to wear them.,2,57
I'm a 36b and this for terribly on me,2,37
this thing runs HUGE and the fabric was stiff. no thanks. returned!,2,67
Ring was bent and crooked upon arrival! It is not fitting flush on finger...... maybe I just got a not well made ring?,2,118
They are ok for 7 dollars. They seem kinda cheap. Still cute. They are run big.,2,79
quality was &#34;eh&#34;,2,24
The piece that connects the band to the watch broke after only a few wearings.,2,78
"This dress just looks like a V neck tank top.  It doesn't plunge front or back.  The straps are wide.  It is not anything like the pictures.  Unlike some of the reports mine was long enough and I am above average height.  But, was disappointed in the neck line.",2,261
Appears well made but very small.,2,33
I wear size 4-6 US size. So I bought medium according to the size chart. It didn't fit at all. I will either return or exchange for large size.,2,143
The eye of my sneaker was very small and had a hard time lacing.  I finally  got them on and they work just fine .,2,114
Too small a purse can't fit in it but its can be use,2,52
Too big for me...,2,17
They are too small and too short and too thin. Not a good hiking sock,2,69
The rings were pretty but after wearing them a couple times (2-3 uses) they turned green.,2,89
Two of the 6 pair had defects. Strong chemical odor.  You get what you pay for.,2,79
I didn't like it because I couldn't fit barely anything in it for my wallet. I really wanted it to work because I love the Idea of using old firehose. I returned it.,2,165
"I bought this for my girlfriend after she lost her navel ring. The picture looks far nicer than the actual item does. The item isn't horrible, but it certainly doesn't have the appeal that the picture does.",2,206
Print is nice. Fabric feels waterproof and is undetermined.<br />Smaller cut than described in measurement chart.,2,113
"Really liked this shirt. However, I have a large chest. Did not fit me in a flattering way!",2,91
for a child's wrist,2,19
The outfit is cute but the top was extremely large.,2,51
I ordered an XXL in these and received a small. They seem to be nicely made but now my 13 year old has a new pair of PJs instead of me. Disappointed,2,148
Too tight. Great fabric but wished I would have ordered a size up.,2,66
Waayyyy small. Barely covers my 4 yr old's bottom. Not very good quality either.,2,80
Beautiful jumpsuit for a taller woman.,2,38
Don't bother measuring. Purchase 2 sizes too large,2,50
"The pearls are nice.  But the cubic zirconia is way larger than the image shown, making the entire earring large and awkwardly sized.  I don't like wearing them as they feel too big and bulky.",2,192
"Bought this shirt in August, didnt start wearing until winter and its splitting at the seam. Liked the shirt, but not if it only last a couple of months.",2,153
looks pretty in the picture but the hat is too big. does not fit well..,2,71
"Blouse came completely wrinkled! Fabric in pic looks silky but IRL it’s cheap, wrinkle prone fabric. Returned for Amazon credit only. Disappointing.",2,148
I was really hoping this would be similar to the one I wear when snowboarding. It's not even close. Very thin material and the drawstring does not stay in place so it really only just hangs out around the neck. I'll be looking for something different as these won't work.,2,271
These slippers have added to my foot pain rather than relieved it.,2,66
"Love the cut and shape of the dress, but the fabric is itchy/scratches. The waistband fits tighter than similar dresses I own. Tried returning, but it's apparently not refundable.",2,179
Runs very small. It doesn’t have any stretch so seems even smaller,2,66
Don’t wanna open it cause I’m gonna return this item. This is tooooooo bigggggg!! 😅,2,83
Didn't look good at all,2,23
"Very thin material, fits everywhere but around arms.  This shirt took over 2 months to arrive.  Would return, but figure it is just too much trouble.  Will not purchase from this seller again.  Loved the style, just bad material and fit was very odd.",2,250
Itchy and cheap,2,15
Fit too small. Couldn't raise my arms. Too tight. Order the next size up and hope they send you the size you ordered.,2,117
Material was uncomfortable and the mesh goes way to low. Poorly designed.,2,73
VERY thin material. Shows every dimple.,2,39
Mediocre quality. Fit fine. Kinda see-through.,2,46
Beautiful polished stones! Took out of the package and placed it on my child's wrist and the bracelet snapped and released all the stones.  Disappointed,2,152
Shirt is very thin and 3/10 on softness. The logo is off center so it looks funny. Also the decals are not included.,2,116
It's very comfortable compared to the one that came in the box. But every time I adjust it on my wrist  it falls off.  It's fallen off at night while I was walking my dog and I had to go find it.  The connection points are terrible,2,231
"While i do like these, they are very small and probably will not work with my sarang! oh well.",2,94
Some were really tight. The striped ones jacked up can’t wear!,2,62
"As a result of how tiny the star is, every time I tried to screw it to the back it fell out of my hands or out of the pliers. Well, it fell somewhere on the floor of my bathroom and with a flashlight both myself and my husband couldn't find it. Oh well. At least it didn't cost too much.",2,287
"I like the keys, I like the magnetic closure but I don't like the hinges they are flimsy in mine broke in two days",2,114
Super pretty ring. I really loved it and was so excited about it but stone fell out the very first time i wore it.,2,114
This was described as soft flannel. It is not soft at all. In fact scratchy and stiff even after a wash..very disapointed,2,121
Fits perfect and the material is comfortable. Looks great at first. I really loved it until I washed it for the first time. Still kind of cute but the velvet lines are the reason I purchased. Kind of like buying a graphic design shirt and then it peels after you wash it 😖,2,272
"These were definitely not as expected. I bought them as a gift and now I have changed my mind, as they are so big, almost to the point of being bell bottoms.",2,157
"I ordered the blue & white dress with the leathery belt. I’m 5’2” and it almost hit my ankles. Yet, the top fit in a weird way. It wouldn’t be a dealbreaker if it wasn’t for the noisy fabric. Not great for wearing casually, but good as a costume piece.",2,252
Too dark not as see able as picture,2,35
"Shockingly sheer, with weird, crinkly, shiny fabric. Heavily polyester. It's a shame, because I LOVE how it looks in the photos.",2,128
Cheaply made tool for removing extra links. All 3 pieces they included broke. Still have extra links that need to be removed. Now I have to take it to a jewelery store to be fixed.,2,180
Kinda bummed out since this bag was the perfect size and canvas material. BUT the one I received had broken zipper pull straps. I can definitely DIY some makeshift ones but I really needed the purse ASAP for a trip and now I have to scramble to fix it :/,2,254
Cute patterns but not so good craftsmanship. There were a lot of loose threads. For the price though it’ll do. Makes for a nice covering over a filter mask. You get what you pay for.,2,182
Poor fabric! Very expensive for the quality.,2,44
"It's a very cute necklace and perfect summer wear. However, it's very cheaply made and lasted only 5 days on my daughter's neck. The chained clasp portions on the wire completely fell off and could not be fixed.",2,211
Cute earrings but look more like paper towels than toilet paper... Wouldn't have bought if I knew,2,97
"Socks were as pictured except in miniature ... description says ""adult size 6-12""  which total BS.  Might be child size 6-12 .  Very disappointed.",2,146
Poorly made. Flimsy fabric.,2,27
"El tamaño del Jersey muy pequeño, lo compre S y es realmente como XS",2,68
Super thin. Not very warm.,2,26
"The fit, color, and overall look of these jeans are not what is pictured. The crotch is wayyyy too low. The flare is from the upper calf down instead of above the knee. Im 5'5 129lbs.<br />My first negative review on an Amazon product in 3 yrs. Dang it, I wanted these so bad, too! What a let down.",2,298
not so nice,2,11
It’s okay.  It served its purpose as a beach cover up but i wouldn't buy it again,2,81
"This visor was too tight on me. I'm a 5'3"" woman with a normal sized head lol. At first it seemed okay, but it gave me a headache after a few minutes. Would be better with a velcro strap instead of elastic.",2,206
I like the appearance of the watch. I don't like several things: 1. There were no directions included. 2. I have to assemble the band. 3. It was running when I received it. 4. It looks like it will be very very difficult to insert a new battery when the watch needs one.,2,270
Necklace fell apart after a day wearing it.,2,43
I didn’t get my dress I ordered.got pants instead,2,49
Very cheap made. Top part is way small but the body part fit great. Better for someone with a small chest.,2,106
"These boots are great for wide feet but my feet still slide forward and hit the front of the toe box. The worst part is that color is already peeling off when they have been worn only about ten times, mostly on the areas that bend. Not a big fan. Love the style but I won't be purchasing these again.",2,300
I liked the product and it was very cute but it was just too small and very very short.,2,87
"Nice fit , cute style !<br />Just 1 problem that bugs me , why can’t they get the strips to match , how hard is that ?",2,118
Thought I bought a light blazer but the fabric is poor and looks like you are wearing a long sleeve T. Returned item.,2,117
Product arrived way smaller than described. Material was thin. Returned.,2,72
dress is beautiful but way too small. When I tried to return it they ignored me...BEWARE!!!!!!,2,94
Ran small,2,9
Clasp is much too hard to open...I may have to return it.,2,57
Didnt fit the wife one size does not fit all for busty.,2,55
"I ordered a size up to stretch to 1/2"" but they were way too small.",2,67
It looks cheap and not proportioned. Too small up top and too big from the waist down.,2,86
The cut out sides never stay even as pictured with the lacing and the button on mine fell out after only a few wears<br />They are very stretchy though,2,151
Much different style than the ones I had purchased prior to. Feel of fabric also and refund/exchange is challenging since I have to wait for an email response and approval.,2,172
I understand now why they are so cheap. The leather rips and peels and the silver turns brown in less than a week.,2,114
This watch is not for small wrists. The face of watch is too large and watch constantly turned.  I had to return it.,2,116
I like the colors but thinner material than expected and a little too big foot size. I may return the purple as I had to pull it hard to keep from bunching in the boot no it ripped. .,2,183
"I wanted to have plenty of extra room, so ordered an XXL  Still very small.  Like the material",2,94
Fabrics separating after little wear,2,36
It looks cute. The color is nice. But it does NOT stay put. It shifts constantly and the hinge gets stuck in my piercing canal constantly and it hurts. Once it shifts it’s really hard to move.,2,192
Came apart after wearing it twice,2,33
I ordered a women’s 1XL and it fit more like a Medium. Very disappointed,2,72
Very wrinkly!,2,13
"The entire body of this is plastic. Got one for my boyfriend and thought it would be fancier for the price it was. I'm almost embarrassed to give it to him. Scratch that, I'm totally embarrassed to give it to him.",2,213
"The dress is just cut weird. You can barely see in my photo the extra black fabric. As many reviews have stated, the top piece of fabric is just too long. It looks super odd. I really wanted to like this dress, but it was returned.",2,231
The area where the bow is supposed to go didn’t sit properly. Looked like it was hanging.,2,89
Maybe by head is huge compared to most but these are not wide enough for me,2,75
This shirt looks nice on the model but the fit was awkward on me. Definitely not what I expected. I returned it. (M),2,116
The zipper broke and then fell off,2,34
Didn't like how the neck line fit.,2,34
Def woman’s cut and a lot shorter than in picture. Also seems shorter!,2,70
The lens are so fragile they scratched up almost immediately.,2,61
"This dress was really weird. The fabric is stretchy but thick. The length was fine and the small fit, but it is somewhat form fitting, which was not what I expected. The sleeves were also surprisingly tight. I have pretty small arms and that's never been an issue for me in any other garment.",2,292
"Great idea, but the fingers come off very easily.",2,49
The ballerinas are cute. That's all.  It's made of hard plastic which makes them very slippery.  My daughter (3 yo) used them the first day and I was waiting for an accident to happen.  She has never used them again because are not comfortable and are really slippery.,2,268
Cute but way too small. I'm usually a small/medium and a large was still too small.,2,83
It gets stuck in one mode and won't turn off without taking batteries out sometimes,2,83
Cheap. And too think... Not meant for someone who wants to look slimmer,2,71
Waste of money',2,15
"IT WAS DISAPPOINTING, I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LARGER, THE PHOTO OF IT IS MISLEADING. I WOULD HAVE WANTED A BIGGER RING, THIS IS MORE OF A PINKIE RING. REALLY LET DOWN ABOUT IT.",2,181
Merchandise doesn't look like picture,2,37
The dress is a disappointment.  The waistline is awkward and the elastic in it causes the dress to not stay in place.  It definitely annoys my daughter and she's not comfortable in it and it doesn't look cute. It's made from a semi-shiny cheap material.,2,253
Hat did not display a log in the ad.  I wanted a clean looking hat...the logo makes the hat look funky.  I dont like it.,2,120
Through  out the day I'd  have to keep re tightening the bracelet. Was very annoying.also lasted only a few months before the ojo broke off.,2,140
Not cut well. Fits awkward. Runs small,2,38
Guess I missed reading the small print or should have read the reviews closer....these did not work for my garage door...wrong color code ...so now I have useless openers because you can’t return. Got the right one at Lowes.,2,224
Product was cheap. The leather pulled away from clasp first time putting it on.,2,79
this worked for a few times - get what u pay for,2,48
"It wasn’t the color I thought it would be and it didn’t fit me, cut too round around the hips. Not straight line.",2,113
Beautiful swimsuit but the bottom was much too loose; almost like the elastic was of poor quality - but the rest of suit appeared to be really good quality.  I am going to try another size to see if that was just unique to this particular suit.  It arrived quickly.,2,265
"It was good up until week 2, it never wanted to stay on and eventually fell apart, good for its price though.",2,109
"I am a 32B so I bought a small. I could barely get the bra over my head. Ridiculously small and uncomfortable. Also seemed to run small length wise. After the struggle to get it on and pulled down, the cups were higher on my chest.",2,231
Loved the look but they were way too heavy,2,42
The garment did not follow the sizing chart. I even went up a size from my normal and the cups were too small and did not have the proper support.,2,146
Cheap cheap quality. Not at all built for large chested women. Ripped easily when putting on.,2,93
Fits up top but is not very long. Barly coverend to my waist. Did not overlap to my hip pads,2,92
"The waist only comes to my belly button, the legs are short, and the belt is barely long enough to tie a tiny bow. The belt loops are sewn onto the top ruffle part, rather than the waistband so it slides up over the back instead of cinching the waist. Only good thing is the fabric feels nice.",2,293
"It's seemed well made but according to my girlfriend it has designer flaw's, Change falling out.Just can't keep it together.",2,124
poor fit; waistband was a &#34;waste&#34;,2,41
I didn't like the material and on me it came away too much from my belly.  Would've been a good maternity dress though.,2,119
"These leggings were way too small. I’m going to give it to my daughter-in-law. Hopefully, it will fit her.",2,106
Not as heavy as I wanted. Very light weight top.  Needed it to be a bit thicker of material.  Cane after Xmas<br />. Late for present.,2,134
"The fabric looks really cheap, like its just screen printed. I don't have high hopes for this shirt.",2,100
I ordered biggest size which is 3x it's not a 3x!!!! More like a L,2,66
"Not really what I expected.<br />The picture makes it look like the buckles are shiny, glittery and raised.  But it's one piece and the buckle is just purple (faded) ink.  Nothing fancy about these at all.",2,205
These are cheap even for the low price.,2,39
"Very cheap, returned immediately. The piece of fabric that is supposed be the top has no stretch/give, so it'd almost impossible to make it work around normal body curves. The fabric is see through and like sandpaper.",2,217
I expect the zipper to break within the first month of winter.  But it feels warm.,2,82
"After measuring and going by the size chart, I ordered this top and it arrived and to my disappointment it was incredibly tight around the breast and the material is unforgiving. The design looked cool but it was just not going to look good on a larger chest (DDD).",2,265
Does not look like the picture.  Look really bad.,2,49
The mask was very small.,2,24
Feels like one drop could break these into pieces. Definitely not durable.,2,74
strange fabric. didnt flow nicely like the picture. returned it.,2,64
The ad suggest they are very pliable & soft.  The pair I received were not nearly as soft/cushy as the ad suggested.  They were true to size (81/2-9).,2,150
Too big . Size chart not accurate,2,33
Material is really thin and cheap. Feels a little like Halloween customers material. But the design is very nice. Hopefully a little ironing and starch will get this good enough for the office. I bought 5 other better dresses at the same time. I wouldn’t bother with this one.,2,276
Fabric is not what is expected,2,30
"The shirt was quite thin and extremely tight.  I probably needed a size or two bigger.  I returned it.  Might have been okay in larger size, but overall, didn't like it.",2,169
Nice! But color look brighter on picture than it do in person. It looked more navy blue.,2,88
They came chipped and cracked when I received them today wasn't pleased make them cheaper if there gonna come cracked and it wasn't the same as the picture,2,155
Started falling apart the moment I put it on! Sadly such a nice looking embellishments had to go back,2,101
didnt fit so well,2,17
"I’ve ordered and kept 3 other ‘one size’ skirts from this company, this one is a loser.  The size would work fine for a child but the average woman (5’4”. 150 lbs) doesn’t stand a chance.  The print is pretty, I really did want this one to work but it’s a total no!  Save yourself the trouble.",2,293
The material was very thin - not in a good way.  The cut was wrong for my pear shape.,2,85
can't see the numbers. I gave it away to someone else.,2,54
Very see threw. Not a big fan,2,29
The bustier area fall apart just with one use. Very disappointing,2,65
I purchased the plus size in these based off of my regular bra size and the fact that other reviewers stated that they run small. They were huge on me! They do not do free returns so it cost me half as much as the price I paid for them to send them back. Lesson learned.,2,270
"Looks nothing as pictured, but at 5'10 size 16 I should have known better. It's really short so I'll keep it and wear it with tights I guess.",2,141
Uncomfortable.  During the night I take it off because I find it on the floor in the morning.,2,93
Belt is stretchy. Weird quality to have in something that's supposed to hold your pants up.,2,91
"Material was different than the floral one I ordered, so this one was too tight would need a XXL with this type of material.",2,124
Got to my destination but zipper promptly broke,2,47
Doesn’t stay on,2,15
Collars are big. Like a strong wind might take you airborne big.,2,64
Very cheap. Made out of plastic.,2,32
Almost great. Just to bulky for me.,2,35
"Too short.  I also hoped for a soft jersey fabric, but this one was not soft.  I will be returning it.",2,102
The top was very thin. I would not wear something that thin.,2,60
I loved the idea of these but my son destroyed the string in the first 5 minutes of wearing them. I'm going to try and re-attach it but I was disappointed.,2,155
"This is neat how you can see all the words in the stone, and pretty, but it bent out of shape within one day.",2,109
Beautiful top but very sheer and the breast size is for someone very tiny. Even with an extra large and I am not by any means a big girl.,2,137
The glasses hurt my nose - scratchy so i returned!!,2,51
"I bought these for my daughter's birthday. She wore them once and then one of the sneakers lights stopped working. Despite charging they never worked again. Unfortunately because I had purchased them in advance and gave them to her as a gift, it was too late to return or exchange them.",2,286
One strap was broken onone bra. Pretty disappointed in that but they are pretty inexpensive. Love the look. Fit well. Unfortunately I’ll have to send back and will probably reorder some where else.,2,197
Way too small compared to how it looks online. Sent it back as I was hoping for a heart that people could actually see.,2,119
"Quality seems good, but the large size is still too snug on my size 5/6 daughter.",2,81
Size is off fits too snug. I returned it.,2,41
"Got this for my mother, she said it's way too short in the back, otherwise it's a fine fit.",2,91
"Unfortunately, it's very cheap looking. There are no zippers or anything to fit in, but the lace part of the material isn't stretchy enough to really form around you, so it ends up sort of loose in weird places. Great idea, not great execution.",2,244
"These fit weird, they want to 'ride down', but they're not too big. Also the fabric isn't very soft, almost nylonish.",2,117
I dislike them because some of them have holes in them and they are not tight enough on my arm,2,94
At least two sizes to small I ordered a 11 and bet it's only a 9,2,64
"Two stars because it’s super cute, but also two stars because it’s extremely tiny! I’m not talking about shape and style, I ordered a large for top purposes and it could have fit a child 🤦🏻‍♀️",2,192
These give 0 compression.,2,25
"Small at the shaft , fit the foot.",2,34
so short it wont cover a bra,2,28
"product quality was BAD!!! shirt very bad quality and really not soft and not comfortable on my bady,..the worst thing,..that is TOO LARGE!!! i have sizing my body actual from the shirt chart..but what i got is too big?!! shame on you amazon!!! i really dissapointed!!!",2,269
"Looks cheap in person.  Way too small for my head, and the hat is not stretchy at all.",2,86
Demasiado grande la talla,2,25
Looks a little bit on the cheap side but it was $28. Hardware especially looks cheap.,2,85
I liked the look but they don't fit.,2,36
Poor quality & looks nothing like its pictured. Ugly.,2,53
They do not shine like the picture shows.  They look like a cheap store pair of earrings.  I will not wear them much.,2,117
"These are smaller than what I expected and cheaper made, have already lost one as it fell out of my ear.",2,104
"Wasn't worth the money, very cheaply made,  tight around head wouldn't recommend buying them! Sorry I spent the money on them! Fit me three year old niece, she plays with them!",2,176
I got a small and they were still too big,2,41
It was to small to be used as a mala.,2,37
The product works well while new.  In about 3-4 days it wore through; and I don't work out a lot.,2,97
"This hat was a long tube of a hat, not the least bit slouchy as pictured. I cut it off to make a shorter toboggan that fit much better. It was well made and I like the color.",2,174
Came in for clearly a very petite woman when I ordered a 38C. I couldn't even try it on. I'd guess it would fit a 30A or B.,2,123
"With no back, they keep slipping off my feet.  About killed myself going downstairs when one of them came off as I was taking a step.",2,133
"Looks beautiful, material is soft, but way too small. Ordered a 3x thinking that with 2 sizes larger I had a chance at fitting it. Nope, so I gave it to my size small friend. Fits her great.",2,190
For very small kids,2,19
"I love the shirt and I read reviews that the shirt runs small so I ordered at least two sizes larger to avoid disappointment, however, it was still too small.",2,158
"You get what you pay for, price is reasonable for the quality.  Material is VERY thin, if you are looking for something similar to Vie Active, this is not it.",2,158
"They are good but run big , and don't fully protect from wind as they are supposed to..",2,87
I have to wear these everyday at work and they still fog up smhhh,2,65
I really wanted to love this dress. It appeared to be made fine it just didn't fit right. There isnt a way to tie it to fit so while it fit on top it was baggy in the middle and wasn't at all flattering. Might be more flattering on body types but it was a miss on my pear shaped body.,2,284
These are cute and would be perfect if they were designed (length wise) with women 5’5” and taller in mind. The pants stop at mid calve for me. No bueno.,2,153
"Cute shoes, but they fell apart within a few weeks. The tag on the back ripped off on one shoe, the laces tore on the other, and overall they looked worn out and scuffed. They were only worn by a barely-walking baby who is under a year old, so I feel they should have held up better.",2,283
Bought this for my girlfriend and she stated &#34; I usually wear a size 10 for my skirts and pants but the large did not fit once the zipper was going up. To tight.,2,165
I'm sure that some tall willowy woman could pull this off and not look like she purposefully cut the holes in the top but I cannot. The color was great but the holes just looked silly on me.,2,190
"Runs 2 sizes smaller, like boys not mens",2,40
The medals on necklace and earrings are totally different,2,57
"You get what you pay for - The pants are comfortable and have good pockets, the material is slick and doesn't feel bad but it is very cheaply made and appearance wise, these don't look great. Definitely not keeping them.",2,220
cute but too big for my 10-month baby even I pick 0-6months.,2,60
"Not what I expected, it was too big and bulky.  Thought it was the size of a small wallet, instead it is the size of a small purse.",2,131
"Don't really like it, I'm using it as a nightshirt minus the necklace. Cheaply made. Not flattering.",2,100
"I like the style of this shirt, and the size was correct to what I typically order, but the material is much too thin.  Shows the extra &#34;fluff&#34; on my back and stomach that I'd prefer not be easily seen.  Will be returning.",2,230
Material is the equivalent of wearing a plastic bag. Style is cute. Fabric does not breath at all. Too short. Elastic waist is irritating.,2,138
I liked the style but they were way to small. I  typically order small but ordered a medium and it was not a good fut,2,117
Did not like.  Older and wanted to protect my arms from scrapes,2,63
Not same collore,2,16
"Love the way it fits, but this is my second pair because my first pair already has holes in it, the fabric is flimsy and seems to be wearing out too quickly, even with delicate wash and hang dry. Bummer...",2,205
"Even though I ordered a size up, they were still too tight.  Outrageous amount to mail them back to CA,",2,103
This doesn’t fit my son at all,2,30
"Delivery was excellent and came sooner than expected! The choker is exactly as described! But the charm is cheap to me, all the pepperonis aren't painted and it is also bent! Doesn't look like picture! I bought this choker Bc of the cool charm .. I'm disappointed",2,263
"Just okay.  It looks very close to the genuine Apple version, and feels relatively close--but one end refuses to &#34;click&#34; into permanent place.  I'd likely give it 4/5 if both ends seated properly.",2,204
Too Short and too tight. Going to return it,2,43
It’s a cute set but the bottoms are completely see through! I was so happy I caught this before the party I attended. The fit was a little bigger than expected too.,2,164
I liked the look of bracelet but lost it the first time I wore it.  It weighs very little  so I didn't notice. I understand it is modestly priced but some redesign on the clasp is warranted,2,189
Too small and a little see through,2,34
"Cute blouse.  Unfortunately, it was WAY too small.  I completely agree with the comments about the arms being too tight.  I wear a 16/18 and ordered the XXXXL.  Too small.  Bought to wear in a Veteran's Day parade Monday.  Looks like I'm going shopping.",2,253
"I was expecting a jogger, but these were tight like a legging.",2,62
Super tiny so really disappointed it didn’t fit. It is awesome and I gave it to my girlfriend who had a three year old this would fit. My 9 year old definitely did not fit in this and she is tiny. So sad 😞,2,205
Highly Disappointed,2,19
The silver rubbed off to reveal copper after 7 days of wearing it.Take it off when you shower and sweat...and breathe. would NOT recommend,2,138
Very pretty. I can’t wear them because the part that goes through the earlobe is very thick and painful.,2,104
"Thick Thighs save lives not saves.... the end, that is why I could never wear this....",2,86
sizes run very small,2,20
"Not useful, but this could be very subjective.",2,46
They are just ok. They run skin tight and are very thin. So I just wear them underneath another top.,2,100
The suit looks cool but the lights only work when squeezing the battery case.,2,77
Dont like the band on the bk of hat,2,35
I liked these sandals but they were tight in some areas and rubbed.  Sorry that I had to return them.,2,101
It was small and the star wasn’t on it,2,38
"My daughter liked this pendant because the cat was cute and there was an engraving pictured on the back of the product photos posted on Amazon. She was exremely disappointed that the engraving was missing on the pendant we received. Also, the pendant was bigger than expected.",2,276
"These are cute and fit well, except the shorts part rides up horribly, even when just walking. :( Super sad about that.",2,119
I ordered the dress in navy for a wedding. The dress is completely seethrough and is extremely short. Don’t recommend. P.S. I’m 5’2 for reference.,2,146
The picture makes it look like delicate swans but they are really not well made. The hook wouldn’t come out and you can see where it’s glued. They are going back.,2,162
Super thin polyester material,2,29
"I don’t like the material, is very cheap.",2,41
I'd return them if I could. They run small in my opinion. And i'd probably look for something with more spandex and less cotton.,2,128
Feels cheap and fits too tight . Ehh.,2,37
They look great on but they do pinch after about 30 minutes to where I have to take them off. Maybe over time it will feel better? They look great for a quick photo but it’s not some thing I would be able to wear out for a night on the town.,2,241
"There is no tag that says what the material is, however it feels a lot like a cheap curtain",2,91
I ordered 2 sizes up and they were still too small.  They are cute but they need to work with their sizing.  The chemical smell was also very strong.  Had to return.,2,165
"Doesn’t fit right, doesn’t look right.",2,38
"If you're an honest 34, get a 36. I'm 34 and using the last loop. Returning. Leather is sub sub sub par. Buckle has a terrible finish. This belt should be about 8 bucks, seriously. Made in Hong Kong.",2,199
One speaker died within two months of purchasing this item. Now it won't charge AT ALL and we have owned it EXACTLY 6 months. Should definitely have a longer life than 6 months before it stops working completely!,2,212
No complaints at this time with this product,2,44
Runs super small. Arms are t-shirt material. Body of shirt very thin. Returning.,2,80
If you want to loom like a fly... These are the glasses for you.  Maybe Halloween :)  fit good,2,94
Much smaller than expected. Holes on sides make lipsticks and pens fall out.,2,76
NOT GOOD QUALITY AND WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED,2,43
Mostly didn’t like material .. poor quality!,2,44
"I thought these would be okay, I've purchased CZ's before and never had them look so cloudy and dull.  I wish I would have taken the time to return these as they are now just sitting in my jewelry box.",2,201
"The braiding is lovely, but the wristlet came unglued from its metal holder as soon as I started putting my keys on it - I didn't even get to use it before it fell apart! Quality is reflected in its low price point. Will be contacting seller for refund.",2,253
They're okay. Only got half the set.,2,36
se ve muy diferente en la foto que en la realidad nada que ver,2,62
The material is odd and the pose of the model makes the slits seem higher and placed farther forward.,2,101
"The dress was oversized and shapeless, if you decide to order I would definitely get at least a size smaller; however it is also much shorter than I expected. I'm 5'5 and it comes to my knee.",2,191
Doesn’t light up but still cute,2,31
I ordered a 2XL and  looks like a small. Runs  way too small.,2,61
Very poor quality... It looks very cheap,2,40
"It doesn't work properly, even if I set it on time it get itself a few minutes behind from actuak time",2,102
Wish it stretch..... otherwise it's a nice outfit,2,49
No way this sock fits a 6 year old.  Better for toddlers,2,56
"I was frankly disappointed in this ring.  The stone has no amethyst color at all;  the color is more of a solid  garnet red with no striations showing at all. I realize it's not fine jewelry, but I did expect it to at least resemble the photo.",2,243
Two pairs were damage,2,21
Looks cheap..much more than expected.,2,37
It's pretty just to big,2,23
"The pajamas fit perfectly until I washed and dried them. They shrunk so much I discarded them. So, nice pajamas if you hang dry only.",2,133
It runs small especially if you have a bigger chest. Its not ling like it looks in the photo and the quality seems pretty cheap. Would not buy again.,2,149
They were a little small and not as cute as I was hoping,2,56
Price for 2 belts and color,2,27
Nice warm coat but lightweight. The three stars are because the black tie is not as big as pictured but rather a thin strap and the side loops broke after only 2 days.,3,167
The look cheap.  The quality is not good for some me of them.  They Brock the third time wearing them...,3,104
Quality and stitching were a bit lacking. Unique style though.,3,62
It’s very cute but however it’s small!!! It’s really a choker I’m thinking about returning it... IDK,3,100
It is self winding as long as you wear it. If you don't wear it for a day it has to be reset,3,92
"the color that arrived is very gold and shiny. not antique at all. other than that, i like it.",3,94
much shorter than it appears in photo..however can be used as a beach cover-up,3,78
I really like that they are thin and soft for a wool sock but the idea that one sock is supposed to fit a shoe size ranging from 6-10 is ridiculous.  I wear 6.5-7 and the heel on these socks sits closer to my ankle.,3,215
I bought the 2xl size. And it doesn’t fit me. The quality I very good but the size is smaller than the right one,3,112
"Way undersized,had to order 3 sizes up to fit.",3,46
"Based on the size chart, I ordered a 3X. It was too wide. I would just exchange for a 2X except it was also too short for my taste.",3,131
"Cute in concept. Nice material. I don't know how it's possible that it's too short for me, but also too wide. I'm 5'6&#34; and 150lbs and it just didn't fit me in the right places.",3,180
"This is not worth $6, more like $1. Very disappointed!<br />This was just not what I was expecting  for the money!",3,114
"love the pattern and shape of it, but was too small.",3,52
"The set came with 3 black clips, 1 poker dot clip and 2 navy blue clips. Consider returning...",3,94
"The “JPL” is rather thin and matted, but the hat quality is good.",3,65
It was a cute dress but it runs large. I’m a small/medium. I ordered a small and it fit like a moo moo.,3,103
"The small is still too large for my wrist, and the edges are a little rough and snag clothing. I'd love a little smaller size and for the manufacturers to coat the edges somehow",3,177
"Cute dress. My daughter loves it. Thankfully I paid attention to the size reviews, because this dress runs really small. Ordered what was noted as a &#34;6&#34; but fit like a 4T",3,178
Not for bigger belly’s and longer torsos,3,40
"I usually wear a large but the reviews said it runs small so I ordered a x-large, that was to big so I'm hoping the large is just right.  Cute dress.  The material is a little heavy though.",3,189
These are large sunglasses. The only disappointment was that the gold on the glasses was not actual metal its painted on. So overtime it will scratch and wear of.,3,162
"Too small,had to give it away",3,29
"It is a nice product.  However, the coloring on the Amazon webpage made it appear more purple than it was when it arrived.  The actual color of the stones is almost non-existent.",3,178
"They do fit a small head/face - the eyeglasses are a bit heavy - but a good fit,",3,80
I wouldn’t buy these again but they work for now. Listen to the other reviews. They aren’t seamed.,3,98
Zippers Rusty and Black Marks all over Looks like ink Pen broke in the package.,3,79
Was nice but wrong size was sent,3,32
"My 4 year old daughter loved them, saying the inside is so comfortable. However she wore them for 3 hrs outside and the sides are already ripping in the “leather”. They don’t seem as if they will last for long :(",3,212
nice material but was sent back,3,31
These are beautiful earrings but one broke easily and it was a couple days after the return window had closed. Bummer,3,117
they were supposed to be 12-24 month socks. they were so large that my 3 year wears them. other than that they are great socks,3,126
"These are just thin (though soft) spandex, and run very small.<br />My daughter just turned 11 and wears a size 12 slim in clothes, and an A cup bra - I ordered these bras in 14/16 and they fit real snug. Jeez.<br />I def need to replace these with something better.",3,266
"Runs small and is short in length, order one size up at least.",3,62
Did not have pockets as described,3,33
"The apron is what I was looking for, however, upon receipt, I washed it (as I do any purchased item). The seam raveled at the shoulder. It will cost more to repair than purchase price.",3,184
I ordered the size I needed...way too small.,3,44
Rides up just like every other thing I've ever tried.,3,53
"It's very stylish and nice, but it's a bit heavy.",3,49
Nice but I wNted the larger size 22 can I return it,3,51
Looks amazing but the material is VERY thin! My daughter tripped and it ripped.,3,79
"Great fit and shape but fall apart very easily.  For the price, they are good but wouldn't expect them to last with regular wear and washing.",3,141
This product is cheap a little short and the tassels are very small. I'm 5'2&#34; and usually an xs in clothes,3,110
Well it's from China and I think they sewed it together quickly.<br />The top of the suit is made for a child.<br />You need to be very small chested .<br /> took forever to get the suit as well.<br /><br />I would not order this suit.,3,235
Fits fairly tight... recommend getting a size bigger,3,52
Stays on but it’s quite small on the cup,3,40
"picture shows black background, I'ts almost same color as the moon and can't see the stars. it is still pretty however wanted the moon and stars to show up.",3,156
comfortable to sleep with.,3,26
I like it but the way it is sewn you can not see the wording . Which is the only reason I wanted this mask. I don’t think it is worth the $12 I paid for it . I cut the sewing so that the words are easier to read like in my pic.,3,227
"The sweatshirt is made well, good material but fit a bit on the bigger than XL. It is still a decent product, just pick the right size.",3,135
"not the greatest quality sweater. It is heavy and kind of scratchy, there is random pieces of black stitching in the gray fabric on the back. Not terrible for the price but I wouldn't recommend.",3,194
It says it has the non-skid but they don't and not very thick socks.,3,68
Cute but pic is deceiving as it shows inside printed as well...it is not..model is most likely wearing two( the one closest to her being worn inside out and then the outer layer worn correctly. Item fits fine.,3,209
"It's a nice shirt but it's not as loose as it appears, nor is the v-neck that deep. I'm going to keep it because it doesn't look so bad, but it's nothing like the photo",3,168
Was not impressed very cheaply made,3,35
"Not small in width but drawstring is set too high, and I am not even tall - 5'5..",3,81
A bit on the thin side and the pocket zippers are flimsy but I still love this jacket.,3,86
Cute while it lasted bought it in the beginning of the year and now it's November and the are ripping. Worth it since I wear it constantly,3,138
These are very pretty and rich looking. I would have rated them higher but they are a little heavier than I anticipated. I was only able to wear them a few hours comfortably and then had to remove them because of their weight. Perhaps they would be more comfortable on a larger ear lobe?,3,287
Beautiful color fit as expected I would have give it a 5-star if it wasn't on the thin side.,3,92
"Fits true to size, just t-shirt material. Good for layering.",3,60
"Thin material, but fit and image are good.",3,42
"Nice fabrics, well made, but run very small.",3,44
Thought it was straight silver,3,30
"I would say size up.  I normally wear a medium.  This hung open on the outside of my chest.  If I pulled it closed, the pockets bunched out on the sides.  I didn't like that at all. Also came with a hole in the seam.",3,216
Color not what expected; navy is what I wanted.<br />Fabric ok.<br />Opening too big; slips Down off my face.  Maybe should have optional sizes for women and men,3,161
I ripped it from carrying a lot of stuff in it and ordered another one.,3,71
Not a fan of the fabric material used..would not purchase again. The print is nice...the material is not.,3,105
I moved to a cooler climate and I needed clothes to keep me warmer. It's a long sweater so I can wear with leggings. The sleeves are way too long. It's only the second time I ordered clothes online. I prefer trying on clothes in a store. It works for the pandemic.,3,264
Ordered this for my sister as a birthday present. Ot was too big for her and had rust stains on the collar. She said the material is great and she would have loved it. She isn't going to return it because that is how she is so I ordered her another one. Fingers crossed 🤞,3,271
"This product arrived quickly and as shown, but sadly did not fit. I got the biggest size and the length was quite short. Would only work well for mord petite frames. Material was soft too. Sadly, had to return due to being way too small.",3,237
This is a beautiful color and cut nicely but the material is very thin. I decided to return it since I was afraid it would be too clingy even though it was cut big. I believe you would need a slip under it if you wanted to wear it in the daytime,3,245
"While I live this sweatshirt, the graphic on it is peeling off. I’ve worn it two times, washed it once inside out and hung dry. Sad to see it was coming off when I wanted to wear it again.",3,188
Perfect size and looks authentic. Only thing I didn't like was that it turned pink after about a week.,3,102
the anti skid material falls off after only one or two washings.  Socks tend to fall down at the heel.  Stretch out of shape very quickly.,3,138
.The Lock got stuck and I can't open it,3,39
Love the glasses but priced a little high for the quality. I got them for a bachelorette party.,3,95
Blue pair was missing,3,21
can't review yet Christmas present,3,34
Im new to this whole compression thing.  I ordered these because i liked the print and looked like normal sock.  The socks are super cute super soft an super Tight!  I’m 5’7 wear a size 7 and have 13” calves.....BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE PATTERN IS SEWN INTO THE SOCK CAUSING PRESSURE INDENAtions,3,293
"The shirt is ok but the waist of the pants is too tight. Also, I am returning it.",3,81
The shell itself is smaller than I was expecting and color varied. My cat loves it more than I do lol,3,101
It fixed nicely,3,15
"My wife really enjoyed her new hat for two days, then the pom-pom came off...  I give this product a 'meh'....",3,110
I’m size 10-12 large is way too tight,3,37
This piece is super cute and the color is very pigmented which I was pleased with. My only issue is how thin the material is- I was hoping for something a little thicker especially as it’s white (see through). However I do have a larger bust so for smaller chested people this should work just fine,3,298
"Nice and soft material , not oversized or as long as depicted . Regular length sweater at best",3,94
A couple of them came broken,3,28
As expected. Good value.,3,24
A Gift,3,6
"I received this as a gift thinking it was an everyday purse tote...its a great print and nice quality, but way too large.",3,121
The gown is a nice soft light fabric. Theres pockets and the length is at ankles. It's very comfortable and price wasnt bad. Thought I ordered long sleeves but this one had short ones.,3,184
Came apart after my first wear,3,30
Nice design and brought back memories of the days before Netflix! It's a bit small but I would suggest the manufacturer to use a stronger chain. It will break.,3,159
"The cape didn’t button, runs big",3,32
Material is silky and not comfy.,3,32
It fit too tight on my wrist. It may just be because I'm on the larger side. So if you have thin wrists you'll be fine.,3,119
Very pretty but the lens color eventually scratched off.,3,56
Fairly thin and cheap feeling but it’ll do.,3,43
Looking for soft outside & inside. This is soft inside.  House pants for winter.,3,80
"Cute, but way too big. Sizing runs very large. Returned.",3,56
It’s definitely very narrow and tight. Not what I expected. But the slippers self is very nice,3,94
Had to order next size up to get correct fit,3,44
Don't know what I expected but it just wasn't what I wanted. It definitely works and wears well but just wanted something smaller.,3,130
Too bulky to tuck into jeans! Nice and thick but wasn't very flattering,3,71
"It's very nice ,material is great but bigger then I though .",3,60
well if you want everyone to see you in all your glory and what's under your pants this is for you.,3,99
"Love the colors and the warmth, but it is a little tight in the chest and hips and a little too long.",3,101
"I am giving three stars because the product runs extremely small, I got for my 1 year three months baby size 2-4 and fits perfect but my baby doesn’t have a huge feet.",3,167
"The shirt is nice but when I got this shirt the price said 59.00 I paid 78.00.<br />That is a crap,  that they up the price 19.00.",3,130
"While attractive, the watch is huge, and is sized more like those &#34;urban&#34; watches. I am nearly 200 pounds and 6'3&#34;.",3,127
"The top is cute, however the material is very prone to wrinkles. But the back is very cut.",3,90
Material nice and soft.  It does run smaller than labeled,3,57
"Looks nice, cheaply made",3,24
Cute ring. However I ordered the all gold ring and got the gold bee with the silver ring .Still its cute and if your a bee lover it's a must have.The time wait to get it was pretty long about a month but hey I only paid less than 5 with tax and shipping so can't complain.,3,272
"The shirt was far too large. As it came from a foreign country, it was difficult to figure out the sizing. It also arrived very late.",3,133
On high the battery only last two hours. Not what I expected.,3,61
"I realize this is made by Spanx and expected a firm fit but it was much smaller than I would have liked.  It almost feels like a corset and I definitely cannot sleep in it as I had planned.  I recommend ordering up at least one, possibly two, sizes.",3,249
"They are just ok. Not very stylish for a lady, though.",3,54
"I Developed a rash. At first I thought it was my new watch band I put these on with, but it was these metal pieces touching my skin that caused the reaction. Also after the first wear they started to tarnish.",3,208
"These are feathers glued onto cardboard,  basically.  The feathers were a bit crushed and didn't look like the picture. I ended up returning them and getting the less expensive ones ($15.99) from Party City, which were much nicer.",3,230
cheap made.,3,11
All is well except that the stitching opened immediately for three inches on one pair.,3,86
"The quality seems so, so.  It is not fully coloured as the underside is white.",3,78
Too tiny for an adult unless you’re quite petite.,3,49
"It's adorable, soft, warm and stretchy. I ordered my larger size, XL (normally L/XL). I just wish it was a bit bigger. It does form to my body more than i'd like. The best part about it is the cute little ears! What would make it better is having pockets. 7/10 for me.",3,268
It is a decent watch that was less than $10.00 but lordy the case is so thick it is difficult to wear comfortably.  Other than that it looks pretty good for a cheap watch.,3,171
"Nice and thin ,but the side had visible scratches(possibly from a vise).",3,72
"Too short, I'm only 5' 4&#34; and they are short",3,48
This shoe has attractive colors. The toe box however is made of synthetic leather which I think will not hold up to my sons running. I ordered a size 1 but it’s small for my son. He’s usually a size 1 to 1.5 in Nike. Since kids wear socks with this shoe I should have ordered a size 2.5,3,286
"A little light weight. Don’t fold closed as compactly as others I have. But they are less expensive, so a definite case of getting what you pay for.",3,148
I don't like the chrome buttons.It fits great. It wrinkles easy and feels like a cheap motel 6 sheet.,3,101
looks just lit the pic,3,22
"Great for the price. Just wish it looked more like a bee ,and less like a wasp",3,78
The back doesn't stay on as you walk. My heal comes out of the shoes and I bought my normal size.,3,97
The fit was perfect but the sleeves were way too short.,3,55
the little chains fell out the first time i wore it. I tucked em back in but its also kinda heavy... but cute!,3,110
"This was cute, but the top was too big and the bottom fit just right, but it looked all frompy. I returned it. The material did seem kinda see through you may need to wear something underneath. It is stretchy",3,208
"Pretty nightgown, but it fits small.",3,36
It fades,3,8
These seem to run a big small. Returning for a larger size.,3,59
Close fit... The legs are too wide.,3,35
"Very thin which is nice but very sharp edges.  Had to polish the inside  edge as it was slightly painful to wear at first. For the price, good ring.",3,148
Fabric too loose,3,16
"Ordered the small. It’s massive, I’m swimming in it. 33-23-34",3,61
"Its not Crystals thats for sure, more like a clear bead. If I could figure out how to get it on my wrist that would be helpful as well. Its very pretty but its not crystal just clear beads.",3,189
Squished and bent out of shape.,3,31
"They're really cute but you have to be careful with them, the top piece breaks off pretty easily.",3,97
"It'd be even better if it had arrived undamaged. When I opened it, the neck between the fin and the head was split halfway through, having been bent in shipment. The post was extremely wobbly, leaving me extremely doubtful as to the sturdiness of the piece. I will be returning this shortly.",3,291
overall it was bad,3,18
"Nice pieces of costume jewelry, but unfortunately each piece has left green stains on my skin.",3,94
its alittle big for a Pandora bracelet and the snowflakes are not very clear,3,76
The actual pink color is way lighter than the photo. Returned.,3,62
"The sunglasses are as expected, but a little tight on my head. I was severely disappointed that they were shipped in a bubble package so they came flattened and had to be bent into shape.",3,187
Very cheaply made. Feels like they will break when flipping them up.,3,68
Definitely size up. Shrunk in dryer,3,35
"They look cool and somehow helps with the glare, however, they makes everything darker. Not really useful in the fog. Arrived without fiber bag.",3,144
Cute shirt however the size runs small. My daughter is 10 and usually wears 12-14 children’s size.  This just fit and washed -did NOT dry and it still shrunk.  Donation bag it went,3,180
its ok but I don't like the fabric,3,34
"This shirt was clingy across the stomach area-the area I need to hide. Also, the sleeves were way too long. I normally wear a medium and ordered a medium.",3,154
They are safety glasses with studs on them.,3,43
The sheer sleeves were itchy and the material seemed cheap.  Daughter did not like that part and the bodice was smaller than the size measurements.,3,147
My son's a big kid so it's probably just his growing and what not but the pants didn't fit I am returning them to exchange them for a bigger size if possible other then that the make material and all was excellent would purchase again,3,234
"Fantastic fit and adjustability.  Main issue is they are blurry underwater, almost like they are prescription, but above water no issue.",3,136
"Some of the pearls came off straight out of the package. Lies a little weirdly due to the construction/weight, but can't complain for the price. I wanted a necklace that looked like popcorn, and this fit the description but ended up not working out for the outfit.",3,264
cheaply made and ugly,3,21
"Large, cheap looking. Seems more suitable for a child's dress up (but what do you expect for the price?) It is what it is.",3,122
"Nice quality.  Lined.  Runs 1 size small, so size up.",3,53
"I ordered the smallest size but unfortunately it's still too big on me, but I do suggest it for others! But if you're flat chested and skinny like me (5'4, 90 pounds) this won't fit like you hoped sadly! Beautiful dress otherwise",3,229
"This is a cheap quality locket. I was looking for something fun, yet practical and durable for my kid. This fell apart the second time she wore it.",3,147
"The wallet is a little larger than expected..other than that , it is well made.",3,79
This particular item fit more like a large shirt.  I'm 5'3 and 190.  Ordered XL.,3,80
Really small. It's more of a kids bag. Mabe use as a wallet. Though it would be bigger.,3,87
"[[VIDEOID:cd7ce1d6000f8b00ce3fe2dfce092c90]] It's a beautiful dress, mines came damaged. Nice material.",3,103
It fit very strange and I am a hippy lady.<br />Not sure if the size I got was too small,3,88
These shorts feel super cheap. The spandex Bottom layer rides up.,3,65
"Pretty color and nice material, but I would recommend ordering a size or two up.  Runs small.",3,93
"Loved it, but it turned brass very quickly; but for the price that was paid that was expected!",3,94
They definitely run on the small side,3,37
"Nice dress! Bought a Large could have done a Medium I’m 5,1 150lbs",3,66
These are interesting but a bit clunky.,3,39
"El size es un número más de lo normal, no es ligera como dicen pesa lo mismo que una bota con punta de acero, el interior es comodo",3,131
Everything fits and looks great BUT boots really hurt the back of my feet,3,73
"The color was very different.  Half dress was light half was dark didn’t look right!  The size was good, but very thin!!",3,120
Fun little outfit. I'm not crazy about how the shorts fit but i love the tank.,3,78
The product was delivered in good time. The designs were clear and the color was awesome eight the black and white or the colored ones. My only objection was that the upper arm rolled down. Wished that they held up better.,3,222
Fabric is poor quality,3,22
"I wish I sized up, the pants were a little too snug for my comfort level around the butt and thigh areas. Super soft, nice thickness, cute style. Ended up giving to my sister and she's enjoying them! Would just recommend that if you prefer looser sleepwear to size up.",3,268
"I ordered this in a size large (I usually wear a US size S or M) because that was the only size available on prime. It was too big and shapeless and looked like an oversized bathrobe, so I returned it.  It was warm and comfy and I would probably order again in a smaller size.",3,276
lI haven’t been able to get the band attachment ends to fit into the holes on the  Versa.  The attachment ends are too thick.,3,125
cute just a little too exspensive,3,33
looks great but it's not real silver so it turns your finger green if you wear it too much.  Should of splurged an extra $10 and gotten a real silver ring.,3,155
Very cute for child or teen. I do think it is overpriced.,3,57
"Was not water resistant. Bought this for my daughter, she got wet wearing it out in the rain. Not the best quality,",3,115
It has less coverage than expected.  I am 5 5 and 120 lbs and 32 c and I kind of fall out of it.,3,96
"The quality of the product is as advertised, however the size is smaller than my normal shoe size.",3,98
These are great to wear with a sweater dress or if not with a dress a long shirt as they are see through. Very warm and soft on the inside. I like them especially since they come in different colors.,3,199
Chain broke almost instantly...... had to buy a new one.,3,56
The pockets don't lay right. It wrinkles very easily.,3,53
Its a pretty thin fabric and you can see through it.  I wish it was a little bit better from a fabric point of view.,3,116
"These earrings are very large, much larger than anticipated.  Lovely though.",3,76
"Very thick for a sleeveless product, so not what I really wanted. But the quality is good however.",3,98
order size bigger run small other. then that i like them,3,56
"Pic shows it as oversized, IS NOT! Tiny and super short. Tig bitty ladies beware!!!",3,83
"Gold Toe quality, but not the thick ones I've been looking for",3,62
"they are ok, but you can see threw them. I don't like that very much",3,68
Quality is not as good.,3,23
Smaller than expected. A gift for my daughter...  she likes it but will never wear it since the size doesn't match what she wanted.. if you buy this go one size bigger.,3,168
La tela muy caliente,3,20
Awesome idea.  They provided a laser light lets you write on the shirt.  The only reason why I gave it three stars is because it came creased over the reflective part.  I’m not sure how to get the crease out without damaging it.,3,228
It’s extremely short. I can pair with leggings but I was hoping for a dress. The fit is fine just very short.,3,109
Looking at picture I thought it was a faux leather look; but it looks more like black snakeskin.&,3,97
I'm usually size sm/med and I ordered an XL which was just a little too big.,3,76
"It was fairly easy to put on and the fabric is nice and soft, but it did nothing for holding in my belly. My Spanx have twice the hold. The panty is cute and fit well, though you would have to take the whole thing off to use the restroom.<br /><br />I am 5'3 and usually wear a size 18.",3,286
"Quality was very good, well made but size was small so won’t be able to wear more than a couple of times( growing child). This is for the top the bottom was way too small. It was ordered basically for the top; but would not be able to use a swimming rash guard .",3,262
Was advertised as being Blue and Purple. Arrived as Blue and Orange. Hoping the hubby will still like em as a holiday gift..,3,124
"Will return do to fitting, size ordered was a xlarge but fits like a extra small size tag was cut off so can’ See the size",3,122
"It in pictures it shows pockets, did not have pockets other then that it was fine<br />Edit: Whole",3,98
Too tight for a big guy.,3,24
Definitely shorter than the picture let on.,3,43
Ima very small person they were supposed to be adjustable but didn't fit only 2 fit,3,83
"I ordered “black” shorts, got some plaid shorts instead. Good quality shorts, but not very attractive. I really needed all black shorts, not plaid, so that sucked but, I kept them anyway.",3,187
These were good for the price and a temporary fix with fast delivery. but wouldn't purchase again or recommend.,3,111
"There isn't a problem with the quality so far as I could tell, but these have a small waist band and are much larger through the hips. I had to return them unfortunately.",3,170
"It runs  REALLY  big. This is  suppose  to be a  child's one sized hat. Why does it fit a grown woman rather than a child? I wish they made it in sizes. Also, a circumference size (in inches) would be a great idea for the seller (hint hint).",3,241
Top and bottom a little small,3,29
"Just good chain for pics, not actually jewelry u can wear out without it probably breaking or tarnishing. It’s perfect for what I needed tho so",3,143
"I just received the watch today I like it a lot, but when I tried it on I was disappointed. The watch is a little small for bigger guys so it's very tight on my wrist. Only if it came with extra links but it doesn't so going to have to return it sadly.",3,252
Nice looking pants but was smaller than the average size 14.  I would have kept them if they fit.,3,97
Not bad for a cheap pair of sunglasses. They are polarized but not as well as my $10 Walmart specials. Still worth it as a back up I guess.,3,139
Too big on top but too small on the bottom. Otherwise it is beautiful. Lace is very pretty,3,90
"Was very small, but pretty. I gave it as a gift.",3,48
Unique sleeves make this sweater a REAL head turner - lots of compliments!  Fits a little large but fashionably so.  Can’t give it more than 3 stars as the ruffles on the sleeves came undone after only 2 wearings.  Needed to be re-sewn.,3,236
"Bottoms are huge! Keeping because my daughter loves the swim shirt and other top, just using another pair of bottoms from another suit!",3,135
"Way too small. Good material though, wish they had fit.",3,55
"Nothing special, just a regular shoe horn. Does what it supposed to do. It doesn't feel to strong, might break in future. But so far does it's job.<br />I wish the handle was a little bit longer. I'm ok with the length, but I can see how my husband is struggling with larger size hands and shoes.",3,296
Very loose. Would’ve like it to hug more,3,40
Runs narrow. Returned it.,3,25
"I did not receive an extra battery like this says. The wings and ball are pretty but 5 seconds after I put this on, the chain broke and fell on the floor. I would recommend getting another chain because the watch works and its very cute!",3,237
The zippers lasted 1 ride.,3,26
The hat in the photo is not what was received. I received a different Kawasaki hat with a patch.  Kept due to it being close to the holiday,3,139
It is a bit smaller than it's specs.  Gave them to my wife.,3,59
"The picture of the scarf (scarves- because for some reason they send you two of the exact same one- not complaining about that) is different than the one you get. The coloring is off and I prefer the color in the picture. The one I received is more of an burnt orange-brown, it doesn't look as nice.",3,299
"Super stretchy definitely fits, beware of you have bigger breasts then you will have some underboob showing through the cut out. The straps are really long so I had to shorten them",3,180
My daughter broke it the first hour she had it on. Mine is fine.,3,64
"The snap came lose as soon as I tried it on. Other than that, it's a good cover, I got it for nursing. You get what you paid for, don't expect quality. I'm normally an XS / S in American sizes, and the Large fit me OK in this one.",3,230
They are a little bit short for the largest luggage.,3,52
"The pants look good and appear well made, but the size XL is actually an L, and the product is, in reality, even smaller than that. They're going back immediately.",3,163
Decent for the price. Top fits larger than expected but nice material,3,69
"This is such a beautiful watch.  Other people complement how nice it looks.  I want to say how great this watch is, but the sweeping second hand fell off after less than a week of gentle use.",3,191
very pretty but somewhat small,3,30
Just for give away....no used to returned it,3,44
Cute but big at the top area,3,28
Very cute top but a little too small.  Order a size or two larger and do not put in dryer!,3,90
"Was cheap looking... yes, it is a child’s but they could have sold it from the bargain store for a couple bucks.  I guess it’s ok for something that’s going to be at the bottom of a toy box before too long,  but the price was way too much.",3,239
Looks better on model. Not flattering. Cut straight across on bottom,3,68
"Like the dress but too big. Did not have a chance to return by the return date, would like to exchange. I'm a week late, just need a smaller size. Overall good product, but disappointed that I am unable to exchange it now.",3,222
The product is great. We did not read the description well and did not realize it was a women size and not youth. But the product itself is fine,3,144
The pink one was the one I wanted the most. It arrived broken. Didn’t bother with return,3,88
They were a bit smaller than size I ordered. To late to return since wife got them a bit dirty working in the garden.,3,117
Ok I loved the look of shoes wanted to wear them so bad but to tight and I have narrow feet I wear a size 10 Please make shoe fit to size.,3,138
"It's a little smaller than I'd envisioned, and therefore hard to share the inscription",3,86
It’s a good fit but the design is strange. The breast cups have a dent from the design and the bra looks funny under a shirt.,3,125
Yo what's up,3,12
I ordered a 2x.  It looks like a medium.  I'll give it away. :(,3,63
Boning bends out once you wear it for awhile.,3,45
Size down if you do not want a baggy fit.,3,41
Boxy fit. Just meh.,3,19
Needs something at bottom to help hold together like a snap or more Velcro,3,74
"Cute and functional.  BUT the 'bling' is coming off quickly.  Wouldn't buy the 'bling', again.Also, the strap separated from the hook on one of them- could have been a disastrous loss!",3,184
"A good looking navel ring. a tad bit bigger than i expected, but looks good",3,75
Shipped fast and good presentation. I'm glad I opened it first before giving however as the chain was knotted in two seperate places. My authenticity card said $275 not $325 but still nice.,3,189
I actually returned this.  It was just too much watch band for me.,3,66
"Pretty, but necklace became undone after just two wears.",3,56
El grosor está bien pero demasiado cortas.,3,42
I thought I liked the material at first..until it started turning fuzzy if touched to much. And since it was for my 9 yr old the sleeves started getting white fuzz first. Kinda like if it was rubbed to much idk. Not ideal material 🤷‍♀️,3,235
"The finish/texture is not smooth,. I am fine with it being faux leather, but it does not look like leather with its sandpaper texture.",3,134
I ordered an extra large. I'm 5'3 and 135lbs.,3,45
These run very small...buy a size larger than indicated.,3,56
This mask is for a kid or a person with a very small face. It was too small. Had to return.,3,91
These earrings are OK but they are not quite what I thought they would be.  The picture makes them appear that they would be bigger than they actually are.,3,155
Doesn’t fit comfortably. Too low and a bit large and loose. Doesn’t feel like wool despite being wool. Feels artificial. Too thick and clunky to be dress socks but too thin to use as winter socks for warmth. Don’t like the feel.,3,228
It was a weird fit.,3,19
Overall it’s super cute.. but the material wouldn’t last long at all.,3,69
Watch was fine but the band was small. I ended up giving it to a 4th grader. It came with extra battery which was a bonus.,3,122
Returned. I thought it was kind of cute but too long and heavy to be an easy summer dress. My son said it looked like pajamas.,3,126
love the look,3,13
"I like the material, it’s similar to t-shirt material, it’s nice.",3,65
I thought they had a cap,3,24
These aren’t the earrings I ordered but they are nice. The quality is okay,3,74
Love my tikkas,3,14
The earring itself is stunning considering it is not a real diamond. However the very tiny backs that go on the studs are so small I cannot pick them up. I have had to uses backs from other earrings.,3,199
"stone nice, but not packaged correctly, so band got damaged.  silver design sort of strange looking on.",3,103
I love the actual material they are made of- it’s just that they were a bit snug on my hips. They are comfortable and so easy to move around in. But if you have a booty or larger hips order a size up!,3,200
"Doesn't get small enough for my neck. Aside from that, its great.",3,65
This is an ok dress. I’m 5’3” & it reaches above my ankle. The chest area is snug if you have D+ chests.,3,104
Face of the watch is a lot darker than in the picture. Nice size. Great quality for the price. Definitely does not feel like a high quality watch. I use it as my back up watch if something happens to my daily smart watch (like I forget to charge my smart watch).,3,262
It comes very very small!,3,25
The material seems thin and a little see through in the lighter colors. Cute dress but wish it was a better quality fabric.,3,123
"Works like a charm , a bit heavy but nice",3,41
go up two sizes the band is too small.,3,38
Love the case but I don't think it is going to hold up. It has all ready started to crack. 😿,3,92
"Not the best quality overall.  The stamped wings like the rest of the hat, don't look so good.",3,94
"Super cute dress, but very thin and sheer. It’s too sheer to wear without something underneath.",3,95
"A little heavy in the weight of material, although I like that it is long.",3,74
Pretty bag ! Poorly made zippers,3,32
"Westies are white dogs, the Westie Pn this charm is quite yellowish. Other than that It's a nice charm.",3,103
"The leather in these is very nice. However, the metal parts are not strong enough. The first time I adjusted the metal parts that hold the rubber for the earpieces, the loop more or less dissolved in my hand.",3,208
"Sized for grown woman, we wanted some for a young granddaughter.",3,64
"I order size 10-12 .<br />They nice and good material, but my daughter is 10 not a big girl and they fit too small.",3,115
"Colors are off from the listing. Was expecting it to be more calm/neutral colors but the orange is bright. Not sure I want to keep it.  Sizing is always a challenge with Zaful. Small is too small, but medium is just a bit too big",3,229
"Fairly happy with performance and convenience. However, I find them to be a bit too dark. So, I have ordered a different pair.",3,126
The item is advertised as “genuine leather” but what arrived is vinyl plastic. The vendor was very reasonable and refunded money promptly. I do believe the ad should be changed.,3,177
I ordered my normal size and the shirt swallows me. Wish I would have ordered down a size. Still a cute shirt though.,3,117
It' nice but a little too small,3,31
"I love them, but as others have stated- The flares are too wide. I can’t get them in. Would be nice if they had screw fit as an option. Disappointed.",3,149
This hat was made very small. For my toddler grandson perfect!!!,3,64
Shows the nips pretty well if you're into that.,3,47
Runs smaller then expected. One size up or even 2 up,3,52
They wher cute in all but too small so had to give away,3,55
Little on the tight side but everything was good,3,48
"Honestly the title. It's still alright, but there's no definable waistline",3,74
It doesn’t come with the ribbon,3,31
"You can’t really tell the wolves, but my daughter still loves them. She’s 8.",3,76
This dress is adorable but no way would it fit a 5 year old.  This thing was huge.  WE brought it to the beach for family pictures with my grand daughter.  We had to bunch up and tie the back up to even fit for pictures.,3,220
The price was affordable but the paint job was very bad. I don't know if I will even wear it.,3,93
Not as fond of it as expected. Sleeves not fitted....split hem by design. would not order again. disappointed.,3,110
It's kind of hard to get on.  It was a gift and she loved it.,3,61
Such a cute and soft outfit. Love that it covers the zipper tab! It does pile after washing.,3,92
"This top runs really large and could almost be a dress. I ordered my typical size medium, it’s not very flattering but the leopard print scrunchie that came with it is adorable",3,176
"Breaks easily, beside that it’s a great suit",3,44
Good product except the adjustment strap will not stay in place when you set it. Other than that; it's a descent product. I just use a small safety pin to hold the adjustment buckel where I want it to stay.,3,206
Bought 2 pair in October. I only wear one sock at a time because I have a drop foot that swells sometimes. I don't think they should be coming apart at this point.,3,163
"The top itself is super cute but it does run pretty large, even after washing it. HOWEVER, after a few washes, its already getting holes at the seams which is sad. Thankfully its cheap enough to just replace it.",3,211
These were really tight on my calves.  Flew to Europe and had to take them off mid-flight.,3,90
Looks bigger in photo wish there was a photo of it on something for comparison.  Also I bought this for the dark color and the one I received was light colored.,3,160
They might be a good sandal for somebody else - they are well made. Very solid. But I needed more support. The heel feels like It’s lower than my toes. I’m sending them back. But if they’re the structure - they might be good for you.,3,233
I love the bottle part the sprayer does not seem to be working well at all!,3,75
I have an athletic build from weight training and while the shirt fits the biceps and shoulder area are tight.  This would be a compliment except I am proportionate and  other shirts coming from Asia here on Amazon fit,3,218
These are ok.  The material is thin and not fleece. Sending back.,3,65
It was decently thick but once washed it is see through.,3,56
There was glitter all over and it’s not well made but I guess you get what you pay for,3,86
Nice wrap but needs more beads in the middle that retain the cold water.,3,72
Not zip off to shorts. Very thin material,3,41
Too thick :/// hurtful,3,22
"This belt is exactly as advertized, but the buckle is too thin/tinny for me. If that doesn't bother you, and it is lighter in weight than more solid looking/feeling buckles, obviously, then I recommend it.",3,205
"looks very old, used and faded...didn't care for.",3,49
The material was very thick and nice 👍The dress appeared to be very nice for a formal affair. It ran much bigger than I expected. Wish I would have bought the right size.,3,170
There about the size of a small pick-up truck.<br />I will never use it. not sure why so large LOL<br />didn't bother returning it. nice look sock tho :-),3,154
"It looks nice, but the material is very thin and doesn't protect from spills it was intended for. The neck opening is too wide and not adjustable. On the other hand, it's inexpensive and the free return policy is very convenient and generous so there should be no hesitation purchasing it.",3,289
It's a pretty necklace but it's a lot smaller than shown!,3,57
I really like this product! It is so helpful to have the claws on one hand especially for putting pots together...<br />But one claw fell off which means broke off first hour of use so that was disappointing,3,207
Smaller fit,3,11
These are super cute. These are really big and don’t fit me let alone my children...,3,84
"Returned, didn't fit.",3,21
"I was excited to receive this bikini and try it on to see how it looked before this summer, however sadly it runs a good size or two smaller than I expected. It does appear to be made very well and of high quality however.",3,222
Love the color; way too wide for a medium!,3,42
I ordered the XS and they fit more like a medium. The material is thin and extremely stretchy (which isn’t a bad thing)..... I just wish they were more “true to size.”,3,167
"Unfortunately,  the backpack I received was defective. One of the front straps was missing. Of course, I returned it without a problem.",3,135
"I love the look, but it broke the first time I wore it.  I tried to repair it, but it broke again and I lost the link.  I'm sad that I can't wear it anymore.",3,157
Way too small for me - so my granddaughter uses it to dress up!,3,63
"Because I intend to loose weight, I have kept it.",3,49
The flaps don’t seem to work. My glasses still fog up. I like the color.,3,72
The picture is deceiving...I wish there were more circles and less chain.,3,73
I was hoping it would be a little bigger but as I am going to be losing some pounds I don't want to send it back,3,112
Stretches out really fast,3,25
"If you looking for a assortment of earrings for everyday wear that you won't cry if your loose one, this is the perfect set!!!!",3,127
Good price just not the compression material I was looking for.  It’s looser than expected.  I have other compression tanks and these don’t come close to smoothing out anything. Okay as a tank top under a button up. But not as a single tank top I would wear to workout in.,3,272
"Bought for a costume, they were smaller than I thought it would be.",3,67
I like that it is silver and that it is a cat. I don’t like that it is dull and not very shiny. It’s looks worn.,3,112
"Would have been great, but was way too large.  Gave it to friend.",3,65
"The fit is perfect, the material sucks and it's see through when dry, let alone wet.",3,84
It looks a little cheaper in person and the strap is thin.,3,58
Much smaller than I expected. It's perfect for a toddler but definitely too small for an adult.,3,95
I got them for my grandson. I found them tight and hard to put them on him they did not give much my grandson shoe size is 11/2.,3,128
"I love this skirt and the pockets. I give it a 3, because the seam is starting to come apart a little in the back other than that the rest is great.",3,148
The print is a lot bolder than i thought.,3,41
Cute for a cover up. Smells horrible.  Can't beat the price.,3,60
"The watch is pretty, but the band is too small for a normal adult. It was more suitable for a child's wrist.",3,108
This dress is cute in the photo but it doesn't fit me right.  However it's very well-made and cute.  A little too long though. I'm 5'6&#34; and it's way below my knees. Sent it back due to the fit on my body.,3,208
"Good construction, a little hard to work with by yourself though.<br /><br />I wasn't able to wear it because my wrists are too large but my friend was, and it worked well.",3,172
"This looked great on the model in the picture, not so much on me. I wear a small, have a petite physique, and this just looked goofy on me, particularly the shorts. However, I think I'll be able to wear the top with a pair of jeans shorts once the weather gets warmer, so I didn't return it.",3,291
Good product but chest too tight with D breast size cups,3,56
Love them but are smaller in person,3,35
It is much bulkier than I thought it would be.,3,46
Fits very awkward on ladies with small waist and bigger legs. Color was very pretty tho.,3,88
Order 1/2 bigger than you wear,3,30
Def. LOW quality and not put together well,3,42
looks more like a training bib or penny for sports teams.  It's pretty thin and you can see through it.  Plus it's not soft on your skin.  It's not like they cost a lot.  Now I know why.,3,186
"This is a great shirt. Thick, comfy and it looks good. However I ordered a XXL and the sleeves are just too long and the cuffs are rather wide. I wear 35/36 arm length dress shirts and even still when I roll them all the way up to the inner lining the sleeves on this shirt are still too long.",3,293
"Nice, but glad I ordered a size up. Runs small.",3,47
The fabric is really thin.,3,26
"To soft of a material but, comfortable around the house.",3,56
"It was larger than I thought it would be from the description, but at least it was inexpensive. You get what you pay for.",3,121
"Updated. I'm 5ft, close to 200 lbs and bought an XL. It's a perfect fit. Not too loose and not tight. However, after awhile it shrunk and little pieces of lint clinged to it and I can't get it off.",3,197
Nice fabric but the arms were too tight and the bodice was too large. I don't recommend for a fuller figure woman.,3,114
"I loved the look, feel and price, but I received on the 8th and the gold necklace broke on the 17th.",3,100
Smaller than expected but looks as cool as in the photos.  But quickly degenerates to fuzzies and has a very short life looking like new.,3,137
Feel of fabric,3,14
Tab bit on the small side and there were some dangling strings when I got it.,3,77
Just like other reviews the model must be wearing one at least 2 sizes too big. It's not nearly as long as one would hope and the material is very thin. But you get what you pay for.<br />I'll definitely wear it because the colored sleeves are super cute but I would never order another.,3,287
Slip stopped right under my behind,3,34
"I did not get the colors that were pictured. The quality and everything else is great though. I'm sure I was a one time mistake, but still sad :(",3,145
"It's the only fitted hat I've found, so I ordered it.  I don't like the synthetic material.  The sewing quality is average.  It won't fit what I want, but for an inexpensive fitted hat, it's not bad.  I doubt it will hold up for long.  Order one size smaller and it should work.",3,278
"Used for church usher uniform.  Too short and after I washed it, it shrunk.  Hard to get wrinkles out.",3,102
To small poor quality,3,21
"I have two pairs of these shoes for my girls. They love the style. However, the rhinestones don't hold up well. If you need an affordable cute shoe, these work pretty well. If your kids wear them frequently, they won't last long.",3,229
Bright Yellow not a light yellow like the picture,3,49
I love the stainless steel they only thing I sont like was I thought it would be more dainty still love my necklace though,3,122
I bought it for my sister and she liked it..BUT she has a thin waist and breasts higher than the average body so my gramma had to adjust. the fabric is not very comfortable then our gramma has sewn a fabric under the dress,3,222
Warm but shrank significantly after washing- had to give to my kids,3,67
They were way to loose and did not feel right.,3,46
Nice pattern but fit a bit too tight.,3,37
They help with night driving. I think the packaging is very nice but the glasses feel and look cheap. I got the gold which look funny. Very cheaply made not worth 30 dollars.,3,174
For a 3x it’s a snug fit around the middle but the sleeves are just perfect length,3,82
"Way to small in the bust area ...... But I'm a DD, so most items run tight.",3,75
Brigth yellow!!!!!,3,18
Very attractive but would not fit any charm bracelet I had. Opening just a little bit too small. Beware of RESTOCKING FEE on return.,3,132
Nice quality leather; bigger than expected,3,42
"Liked the design and bling, larger than thought, but some of the bling came loose after a day or two.",3,101
Cheap made but got the job done,3,31
You get what you get. It was a little worn when it arrived..and kinda poorly made,3,81
"... but I'm keeping mine because the shape of the mask makes it easier to breathe. I can't imagine men could wear this ""One Size Unisex"".",3,137
I like the light material. Size is just a wee bit big but that's expected cuz I ordered them so my son can grow into them. Besides being to big right now he loves them. I'm sure in like 3 months they will fit perfect.,3,217
"I initially loved this bracelet, however, it tarnished very quickly and did not clean back up very easily.",3,106
Too large for ladies.  I wear a size 7 ladies glove & these are too BIG.  My thumb pops out the slit & the mitten covering is bulky just too large.  They are OK for driving to work in the morning.  They are warm & seem well made just super big for my small hands.,3,263
On the small side.  Can't wear glasses underneath like I could with older pair.  Pretty cheap price but also very cheaply made.  Doesn't seal great (lets snow in).  Will probably give to the kids.,3,196
looks really cheap not so much as the picture,3,45
"I bought this belt for work, and not really happy with my purchase. The buckle itself is too bulky and not comfortable at all.",3,126
Straps seem to get longer and longer. Or my son may have needed a different size.,3,81
"The LED lights stopped working after about a week, but my son stills like them since they are very comfortable for him.",3,119
"It's inconvenient to have it slip back through the belt loops, then you have to chase the ends around to get them back to the front. Holds together well once clipped though.",3,173
"they are of good quality, but not comfortable.  tops roll down when sitting",3,75
Pictures are. It accurate. They are flimsy.,3,43
I like the fabric & the style. I ordered size L & XL & still somewhat small.,3,76
"This ""blue and white"" sweater is more green than the blue in the picture.  While it is a decent sweater, it appears to be a cheaper knock-off of the one pictured.",3,162
"Decent product, feels a bit cheap.",3,34
Omg my feet hurt so bad I had to hurry to take pictures. I was told you size up which I did shoes was still too small and part over my toes hurt the most! It’s so tight!! Like I know I was fat feet but jeez,3,206
ran a little small and I ordered a size up,3,42
"Love the color.  I do not like the stiffness of the band; I expected it to be ""leather-like"".",3,93
I do like the robe - but washed it immediately after trying it on.  It smelled like women's perfume and I found a used Kleenex in the pocket.  It was clearly returned and the seller did not bother to check it before repackaging it.,3,231
I dropped it one time and it broke.,3,35
Runs a little big. I wear a small and i ordered a small based off of reviews. My waist is pretty small but to say this nicely my bottom half could fit a medium. I thought it would fit perfectly but it was just a little too big. The quality was good though and i will be reordering a XS,3,285
"The watch itself is nice, the only problem I have with the watch is the band. It seems like the watch is uneven and I have to push the watch a certain way in order for the watch to connect to each other.",3,203
The mirror is starting th have spots,3,36
"Runs a little wide for little feet, i buy a size big so my kids can grow into them, but they slip out of these easy, no way to tighten the elastic laces. Still a decent shoe",3,173
"It's not as nice as the photo. Not as polished, and not as clean sculpt/casting....",3,83
They work well blocks all noice but are a little heavy...I purchase these for my grandchildren because it said they were good foe children but they are very big and heavy on the head they will probably never wear them hopefully the parents will get some use out of them,3,269
"Very cute, and well made. Only 3 stars bc the top offers no real shape or support for &#34;the ladies&#34;. Gives you one giant long shapped boob.",3,146
Not enough support for a heavy chested person and it runs small,3,63
Hardly any down. Very overpriced. More like a late spring jacket.,3,65
"I think the clip part, is too big, which makes them look a little cheesy.  Overall, these are just OK.",3,102
"Arrived with watchband disconnected on one side. Because I had a special tool, I was able to reconnect. Looks and works fine.",3,125
Not a good quality,3,18
"Came wrinkled (shipping hazard I suppose), I left it hanging to see if the wrinkles will fall.  It's a tad larger than what I expected.",3,135
Followed stores size chart & should not have these run true to size . Gave to sister .<br />Reference I'm 5ft 4 in waist currently is 43 inches ( quarantine fat ) 😒 XL would still fit chart reads 2xl . They were decent quality .,3,228
The fabric these are made from was irritating to my skin.,3,57
Fine for the costume,3,20
"These pants are lovely - the fabric is lovely and they are well made.  However they are straight legged,  not boot cut as described by another reviewer.  If these same pants were offered in boot cut my search for well made washable dress pants for work would be over.  Please make these in boot cut!",3,299
They do not sit flush in my watch. I will probably stick to Apple brand.,3,72
looks better online and not what i expected,3,43
"This dress was super cute, I'm 5/8 and weigh 160lbs and ordered a large.  It's somewhat big and I didnt' really like how it looked on my belly, so I had to return it.",3,166
A little bulky- bigger than I expected,3,38
Dress is beautiful as shown in the picture. Color is very vibrant and very skin friendly. But there were lots of loose thread hanging.. and also the bow was big disappointment. It had rough cut shown.,3,200
Faded way too fast,3,18
"Love this cover up. But it rips easily,both under arms ripped with my first use.",3,80
Looks like a bathrobe! But a NICE bathrobe!,3,43
The inner sole was lifted at the edges when the shoe arrived. The size is a bit big. I usually wear a 9 and it's pretty loose with this shoe.,3,141
"Cute, the Red color is definitely pink and the material is a lot lighter and cheap feeling than I would have hoped. Length is long - knee length for me, I am 5'2&quot;. Sleeves are a bit shorter than the picture makes it look. Wouldn't buy again but it's not bad either.",3,270
The number are too small for me to see.,3,39
"An XL usually fits me fine. These are mighty skinny, though I was able to squeeze into them, and they are considerably longer than average. They are pretty and the fabric is nice but I worry about longevity, given that I'm stretching the fabric more than I would like.",3,268
Beautiful shirt but extremely small. I had to give it to my daughter,3,68
More for fashion than warmth. Thinner material than I thought.,3,62
"These look nice, my husband really loved them, and they fit his face nicely but they broke within a month even with careful handling. We won't buy again.",3,153
soft material not to this. Had to replace the stone that was in the button because it fell out. Runs big so I would suggest ordering a size down,3,144
I gave it three stars because it was a nice price for the ring but it became faded and tarnished within a week or so..,3,118
"I do love this shirt, but as a night shirt.  It is very big/loose and the front is not fitted at all.  Even tried to use it as a gym shirt but it was just too big/baggie and to much hassle trying to constantly adjust.<br />Also, it is extremely sheer.",3,251
"I love the keychain, but each photo contains two keyrings, but you're only buying one. False advertisement.",3,107
"Really cute watch, don't put it on too tight, mine broke",3,56
This dress was much shorter than I anticipated,3,46
I am used to the Lee relax fit shorts and these were just a little too straight for my hips and legs.,3,101
"The hat was nice, as pictured. Unfortunately, it had a black mark on it.",3,72
Definitely too big. Ordered a 18-24month for my daughter who usually fits 24 month & it's way to big. The headband ran small too. It's super cute though & I'm going to be ordering in the next size down.,3,202
"They fit nice and I love the lens color. Had to return the pair I'd received due to a defect in one of the lenses.<br />Overall not a bad pair of sunglasses, but the plastic is a little cheap.",3,192
It's okay by me !,3,17
"I like the material and the way it would fit, but it was a lot smaller than I thought. I even bought a size up from my normal. Really tight around the chest.",3,157
I like these donut rings but a couple arrived broken. It looks like they are packaged well but they are jammed into one bag too tightly. They need to work on that to avoid poor reviews.,3,185
Pretty print but runs small and when the fabric is stretched it becomes a grey white tone. Flimsy material. Hoping it doesn't fade if washed.,3,141
I wear a 7 1/2 and bought a 7-8. I should have gotten an 8-9. Nice and warm though.,3,83
I really really wanted to like this. The fit and length were perfect but the sleeves did not match and were sewn incorrectly. It would have looked great other than that but it looks super cheap with the sleeves not matching.,3,224
Too small  Difficult to be able to appreciate the muramos glass,3,63
"The colors don't seem to be as bright as in the pictures and the notches look kinda cheap. But they fit, perry close to size if not a tiny bit big.",3,147
Cute but falls apart pretty easy.,3,33
Very thin lace,3,14
Material is flimsy,3,18
They look great but are very delicate. They just broke within a week.But its worth the price.,3,93
"Definitely NOT a ""sun umbrella."" The material is so thin, it barely casts shade, and the sun shines right on through. The size does make it nifty though.",3,153
The material is very thin and runs large.,3,41
A little large,3,14
"I'm usually a medium, but when I tried it didn't fit as expected.",3,65
Can't understand the measurements.  Just need the shoe size numbers.,3,68
"good rubber grade, the size is supposed to be X Large, but it seemed to be Large",3,80
"These were much smaller than stated, cute, but they are too tight for my petite 7 year old",3,90
"Definitely order up a size. I normally wear a M (I weigh about 125), but the bottoms were WAY too small. The top cuts into your boobs a weird way. Might look better in a different size, but I did not like this product.",3,218
I liked the quality and color but the dress was too big for me and the sleeves were way too long. I wish it would have worked out!,3,130
"The shirt was beautiful but too snug around and under the bust line, was way too tight around the midriff. Had to return it.",3,124
"Relativamente sencillo y no es muy seguro ,ya que no se adhiere muy bien en el lugar que se lo ponga",3,100
Nices shirts for the money but run very. small. I had to pay for return shipping.,3,81
It’s a bit of a thin material. I wore it over a bathing suit instead as a regular dress. I bought a large following the size guide and it’s an A line dress so it’s big.,3,168
Cute skirt but small and extremely short on me... and I'm only 5'2&#34;!,3,72
"I thought it was a beautiful product until I put it on, went to tie it and then it cracked at the nose in half.  Now it's useless.  Not sure if it a defect or because I live in a colder climate.",3,194
"A nice purse, but the clip on the end of the strap was broken.",3,62
Cute tails for making pendants for mermaid party.  Disappointed that some of the tails were broken off.,3,103
"The PJs are soft and comfortable.  The however did shrink in the first wash. I got a large for comfort.  It now fits like a medium.  If it didn't shrink, i would have given it a higher rating.",3,192
Received the wrong color band. Wanted the Black and Yellow but got the Blue and Yellow. Kept it because it matched another watch.,3,129
"Nice lenses, only problem was they fit too tight against my head, behind my ears, and I have a small/medium size head.",3,118
The dress was too cute.  It was just too small for my daughter.,3,63
It looks very nice on me but I don’t particularly like the feel of the fabric. I will keep it and wear it though but not one of my favorites.,3,141
"Cute shirts,kind of thin and too small",3,38
Actually I loved it but I just wasted it once and got smaller..,3,63
Nice shirt but material way to thin,3,35
The top was too big and the bottom was a little tight,3,53
First impression loved these boxers. First great didn't slide down or anything like that. Compared awesomely to under armour. Until I wore the grey pair. The pair that somehow was a size smaller than the black and the red pairs. Only knock I've got is they aren't the same,3,272
The color is beautiful however the top did not sit correctly on my chest. It fit very low.,3,90
Not what I expected but it’s alright,3,36
"I wanted to get this to hide my stretched out baby belly. It didn't really do the trick, but it did work better than the Khaya one.  However, my belly wasn't hidden.",3,165
This leaves my wrist blue every time I wear it.  None of the other colors do this.,3,82
"The bathing suit that arrived isn’t quite the same as the product photo, as a result the funny 3D effect is lacking. My son isn’t picky so we’re probably keeping it seems like decent quality and will last a couple summers.",3,222
The colors are not as bright in person as they appear in the picture.,3,69
"Geez Louise, it's SO small!!! It has XXL on tag ~ for who? Barbie?",3,66
I found these to be very very large but acceptable.,3,51
"The red ""jade"" looks, and feels like its plastic.<br />My kids even told me that it looked like the candy jelly ranchers- how embarrassing!!!<br />However, I do like the color of it...<br />I wouldn't buy it for a gift or suggest someone else to buy it. Maybe for a kid only.",3,275
These fit a little small and the cut made them tight in the crouch and buttocks.,3,80
Decent. Their ok for the price but mine have already started ripping around the waistline after as couple months. Their comfy though,3,132
These sock are good for running and working out but their pressure is not enough for me as I have varicose veins. They are very nice but not what I expected for my medical conditions.,3,183
"It looks like more of a mustard color, but the length, size & style is as you see it in the photo. I’m 5’1 so it goes about 4 inches below the knees but if bring it up and wear heels it looks better. Hope this helps.",3,216
"the ad says 4 pack, but it only has 3 bras.  Also I wanted Medium but got Small.  The price is good, but not GREAT!",3,115
Want to order but size is not shown any where on ad,3,51
This is more like a Tee shirt! Not as happy as I wish I was.  Very disappointing,3,80
This outfit runs big. I like the design just too large for me,3,61
"Other than running a little tight through back, my biggest issue with this coat was that the shoulders stood up like something on a uniform. Not a good look.",3,157
"It fits ok, but the cups are too close together so, instead of pushing up, they kind of flattened my chest because they didn’t fit properly.",3,140
I wasn’t as impressed with this purse as I thought I would be.  Some of the zippers were pretty close to not working.  One of the inside pockets was half sewn up so it wasn’t as accessible as I’d like and overall it just seemed a little cramped.  Love the purple<br />Color though,3,280
I thought it looked great however it rubbed on the back of my neck constantly and I just couldn't deal with it. I gifted it to a friend and they look incredible in it.,3,167
It was huge and heavy.  My teenager through it was wonderful till it hit her back..  it is cute though bulky and heavy.,3,119
Abit small and logo no double sided.,3,36
If you have bigger boobs this isn't the shirt for you. Sadly,3,60
I like the earthy design,3,24
gift.,3,5
Returned. Too small.,3,20
The shirt is a nice quality material with a snug fit. It is not a true white in color. It is off white/cream.,3,109
Nice in many ways but didn't like not having a zippered closure over credit cards. This just wasn't practicle for me.,3,117
This product is soft and comfortable but the material is very heavy. Then elastic at neck area looks very cheaply made. Needs a new design.,3,139
"I am a size 8 all day, every day. The bottoms are tight in the waist and the top is shorter than it looks. Not an attractive look🤭",3,130
Very pretty but color rubs off and it breaks easily,3,51
This was heavy and does not bend.  When my daughter put it on it cracked. It’s like it was spray painted before bending to fit you head.  Your head is oval shape and this is straight. Would not purchase again. Very disappointed after looking at reviews that raves about it.,3,273
I loved the way the dress fit and looked but even with tightening the straps I had to pull it up constantly. I loved the dress as long as I didn’t move lol.,3,156
"Seems to be working fine, but is quite a large watch for a woman's wrist, the case is also fairly thick, but no thicker than an apple watch",3,139
Gave it to my son instead of keeping for myself. Otherwise would have sent back. Large fits me well in other brands. Also I like a pocket I could put things in.,3,160
Order a size or two up,3,22
"Nicely made, nice material and comfortable.  Only reason for 3 stars is that there is only 1 pocket!  I would prefer a few.  If it had more pockets, would be 5 stars.",3,166
Very Nice but poor quality,3,26
Material is very thin but long. I am 6’2” and this skirt the ground. Should be fine as long as I wear a slip or shorts.,3,119
"So far, I've only worn this dress once. Not sure why this dress is not flattering on me. It looks boxy.",3,103
"This shawl is cute and I received a ton of compliments on it. However, it is very short. I’m used to buying shawls/kimonos that drape over clothing, as pictured. But, this is more cardigan length. If I’m guessing the model has on at least 2-3 sizes larger than her normal size.",3,277
"Dress is comfortable and easy to wear. The skirt is more sheer than I expected and is unlined, so a slip is necessary.",3,118
"When advertising this, you may want to include this is for a child. Bought this for my daughter wedding, no way will this fit her.",3,130
The reflective surface doesn’t last.  Already had to throw them away.,3,69
"I ordered the kids size and received the adults.  As imagined, my 6 year old was pretty disappointed considering they were just too big to wear all day at school.  ☹️",3,166
First  the Material is fine . However the Shorts are cut Small. To small for a true Size 32. I Personally will not be ordering from this Company.,3,145
No where near as purple as shown and I may be wrong but these are definitely not polarized,3,90
It would not stay closed,3,24
"They don't exactly fit my wrists and look all baggy, plus they don't have that intense wet look. Im fine with them for now since all i need to do is sew them up. If i had to describe the material its like a non textured  leather.",3,229
comfortable enough but not structured enough for higher impact wear,3,67
Runs very large!  I would size down two sizes at least.  Nice material and color. Comfy!,3,88
"It's a cute shirt, but it's too much for me. I looks like I just got off the boat from Africa.. and that's ok if that's the look you are going for but I wasn't...",3,162
"Shear, cheap, feels more like a slip than a dress",3,49
"It was nicely designed and well put together, but is not true to size- order a size larger!",3,91
Super small don't buy it.,3,25
Cute top but too small and somewhat see through.,3,48
"El body no me gustó la calidad, trae todo pero yo use otro body distinto! Mi ig es stephotmesss y tiktok stephotmess ahí pueden ver más fotos",3,141
TThe fabric is not what I expected and it is narrow,3,51
"I am only 5'4 and this shirt falls right at the top of my hips. I have to make sure my undershirt is long enough for layering just to feel comfortable wearing it at all. As for the neck, it's not off the shoulder its just too large to use a hanger. I'd love it if the length was right...",3,287
"The mask is great , the nose really hurts , there us only 4 masks per package but only 4 mask ventilators so you can only use 4 at a time. Over all is a great mask but not long long periods.",3,190
This is too long and heavier than expected. The stone is too big too. Recommend to list the accurate stone size in the description. Definitely good quality for sure but not suitable.,3,182
"Very easy to install, I have had them for some months now, need to remember you should always store your glasses in its case when not using them, ooops.",3,152
"The waste band is just too wide, I'm talking sweat city at half time!",3,69
As expected,3,11
Like the material not the best fit around the shoulders especially when being wide. A little big I would stick to your size and not size up like I did.,3,151
not very comfy,3,14
You kind of get what you pay for. Not the best quality. It’s not overly flattering but I wear it around the house so I wasn’t too concerned.,3,140
"Great design and idea, they need to be larger. They aren't very comfortable for people who fall on the top end of the waist size. I returned these.",3,147
The pants fit like a 4t but the top was a lot smaller. Especially the sleeves. Tooooo tight,3,91
"Looks really cute, but was really small, even though I ordered up a few sizes. Busty girls beware! I ended up giving it to my daughter.",3,135
They were too tight on my Wife's chest.,3,39
Design,3,6
Very nice but it needs a new clasp as the original  one is too difficult to work.,3,81
"The sleeves are about an one and a half inches too big in diameter,and 4 inches too long at the bottom,otherwise,it fits me great!!!!",3,133
2 of the 3 were great - 1 has very scratchy connections and the clasp is not secure.,3,84
The quality is good but I would size down. The socks they came with was an adult size so my 7 year old can’t use them.,3,118
Wish I could tuck the hood away,3,31
The chest area is much too small. I wear a 38 DDD and this did not even come close to buttoning.,3,96
Turned my fingers green but awesome designs worth the money still. Makes for good gift,3,86
thought they were bigger but still nice,3,39
"UPDATE!<br />After months looks black and ugly, is that correct?<br /><br />Good gift jewelry it’s just like they show, elegant all this for good price.<br /><br />Con: maybe a better presentation or box could give it more prestige",3,231
"I am a size 10, I bought this in a 10 but my heal was sticking out and that makes it painful to wear it because of the hard soul. I think I may other a size 11 to be safe.",3,171
Wasn't as cute in person as in the picture.,3,43
This is a nice item but I ordered the XL it was too small then ordered the XXL and it was too big and then item was damaged.  I was really looking forward to wearing this item I am looking to purchase in White just hope I don’t encounter the same issue.,3,253
Hard to fasten and then later it falls off - it’s happened every time I have worn it,3,84
"I ordered the smallest size, 0-3 mths, but it's larger. Hoping it shrinks in the wash.",3,86
"Quality is okay, but sizing is ridiculous.  Seriously, ridiculous. Postage makes reordering not worth while.",3,108
"I ordered the green socks and while they’re comfortable, they’re not like pictured. They’re darker and more of a forest green than in the picture. Also when they’re on your ankle/ leg they stretch and white elastic shows through looking like a white and green striped sock.",3,273
Material quality is a little thin cheap,3,39
The fabric isn’t the greatest and it runs small.,3,48
"The pendant itself was wonderful though a bit heavy.  The chain broke after only 2 wearings.  With the weight of the pendant and how it moves along the chain, a thicker chain is necessary.",3,188
Price and thickness (lack thereof) made them perfect as disposables on a long vacation.  Would not wear them otherwise.  The side seams are weird.,3,146
Didn’t like fabric.,3,19
"Super cute and light weight, but some of them came broken which was really disappointing. The two colors I was really excited for too.<br />Also, the shades of some colors vary so it’s hard to make exact pairs. For the price though, not bad.",3,241
"Good watch, but can ""fall apart."" You get what you pay for.",3,59
"the bag was smaller than I thought it would be, I thought with the price it would be a standard size.  I will not use all the time.",3,131
Runs large but doubt sizing down would work since it's too wide not too long.... I don't like the elastic around neck but the fabric is really nice.,3,148
If you are doing very light work then ok gloves. But anything above light work the rubber will separate and then can’t grip anything.,3,133
"I ordered two of these. They're cute, but I don't particularly enjoy the fit and the material is pretty rough. I don't mind owning them, but I probably wouldn't order again.",3,173
They are pretty but it’s different than the picture,3,51
Watch dial face is very large and the band is very stiff.  No what I expected.,3,78
"It's very nice, but it should be about two to three inches longer for more options. It fits pretty snug and I am a 27 inch waist.",3,129
"The material is a lot thinner than I anticipated, but it’s a great print/pattern; I liked it so I took it to my seamstress to take it in and raise the hemline - good for the price",3,179
The quality is very nice but the cut is a bit awkward for me personally. It squeezes too tight on my waist and shows a little too much skin.<br /><br />Purchased small<br />Waist 26”,3,182
"We really liked this shoe, but it was 1-2 sizes larger than expected. It is sturdy and well made, and the velcro ankle strap was secure.",3,136
When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised by how cute they were. Then I wore them and the lens popped out spontaneously while I was driving within a couple hours. Not pleased,3,177
"Black one has lasted well,  it purple one edges have all frayed even in a zipper bag on gentle. Both have been washed as well.",3,126
"The snaps are easily broken off. The top snap broke off the initial try on, then a day later the second snap broke off. My daughter loves it, so we are hopeful that the next time it’s worn that number 3 snap won’t fall off. I’m going to have to attempt a repair on it.",3,268
But it gets kinda twisted up as you wear it. I love the way it looks but am constantly readjusting and untwisting.,3,114
"This is a comfortable bra, but for a sports bra, it is not super supportive.  I cannot do high impact activities like running while wearing it.  I wear a D cup.",3,160
"I purchased these to fly in. They were a great fit for just being at home with your feet up. But for flying and lots of movement I found that they rolled at the top. The compression strength was great, and I loved the open toe.",3,227
"they’re super pretty! but unfortunately they are poor quality, and don’t stay in place for long without constant adjustment.",3,124
"Well, you get what you pay for.  I was going to return these, but in all honesty, they are super comfy for a lounging bra and super cheap.  Don’t buy these thinking you’re going to get an decent support, but if you want a sleeping bra, or even a casual bra, these are worth it.",3,277
"Arms are a little on the shorter side. Would've gotten one size larger and kept it, but the outside fabric had a weird smooth feel/sheen to the fabric. I was expecting it to be a cotton sweat shirt material.",3,207
"Although it is a very cute shirt, the biggest size they had to order is still super tight on me. I also do not like the length. If you are of a larger size woman would not recommend.",3,182
"Because this wrap dress completely opens without a hole on the opposing side to draw the string into, it is rather “unfitted” on the chest area.  As a result it is sloppy looking and more or less works as a robe.  Otherwise I like the yellow color and flowing material",3,268
"I really really wanted to like this and it is so close for me, I was about to keep it. But I don’t like the material and around the belly and pocket area it is very saggy.",3,171
"Looks great and fancy but if you want to go for a quality, I would say it’s a no",3,80
Ran quite small. The fabric is also more spandex-y than I expected.,3,67
I like this top but it does run a bit large in the waist area.,3,62
These have large post,3,21
Very nice product just to big for my face.,3,42
"I had thought this had a velcro backing to put on my husband's hat. It did not and I sent it back. If you need just the patch, it is nice!",3,138
"The beads came quickly as promised and all appeared to be very attractive, however they come untied quite easily. Would not necessarily purchase again.",3,151
"Very pink, a little bulky, a little cheap-looking - but hey it WAS a cheap, cute bag!",3,85
Very large. Not Danity at all large fat hoops<br />Pretty though,3,64
not the best fit but for the price its ok.,3,42
Super cute! Don’t wear for more than 1 day though they will fade and lose color! The star one really pokes into my skin when sitting down too. It lasted me three days then it started to fade and look crappy.,3,207
"I personally found it very uncomfortable and frustrating to get on and off. The knob style clasp its sometimes unreliable, and the material itself can be uncomfortable after it gets wet. If it had a normal watch hook i think it would be better.",3,244
I think they need to indicate max shoe size of 8.5.  I wear a nine and these socks before washing would not stay on my heels.,3,125
"Cute. Runs large. Poorly made, but still cute!",3,46
This dress is fun and colorful however I would have preferred cotton material as it is a rayon like material,3,108
"A bit of an odd fit but nice fabric, smaller than I'd hoped in the legs, pockets seem too low on the rear. Waist needs a belt even tho it feels small.",3,150
"It's hard to fit anything bulky in it.  I could squeeze two passport in, but it was tight to snap",3,97
The mustard colored sweatshirt isn't as dark as the picture shows.  It's more a lighter yellow.,3,95
Small on the wrist,3,18
"Not my favorite Smartwool. I found these kinda hot. Would have returned them, but I'm lazy!",3,91
Pa. Todo,3,8
These are affordable but break easily. I like the style.,3,56
Material breaks down quickly. Ingenious design takes a bit to get used to. I would probably by again if item was cheaper,3,120
very sheer,3,10
"It's a good key ring. The bottle opener and light work well, but after first use the ring does not open anymore. It would be nice to remove the keys easily, but not a function I need everyday so I still use it.",3,210
Not nearly as big as I wanted. Completely misrepresented by the picture. The girl must be super petite. I wouldn't call them oversized. If you like huge sunglasses I would say pass on these.,3,190
Super cute and fun but the part that is on you ear is way to pointy. And hurts when I wear these.,3,97
This watch band is more plastic than leather.  It’s cute but I’m sure it’ll fall apart quickly.,3,95
"This sweater is super soft.. but it is way too large! I ordered down a size (small) and it is still too big. I am disappointed because it doesn't even look like the cute oversized sweater look. If you are normally a large, you can order the small!",3,247
"I put tickets to a show in the wallet for a Christmas present for my husband.  Unfortunately, looking at the picture, I did not realize it was so flat and did not have a snap or some kind of closure.  I will probably need to get a roomier one for him.",3,251
"I thought it would have been a little more solid, it feels cheap not great",3,74
You need a larger size then you would Originally wear. Fits tight in chest and armpit area.,3,91
"cute jacket but really small. Also, this is a light cotton jacket but not a heavier denim one.",3,94
"I think the glasses are adorable, they seem to be great quality. The cases and cleaning cloth are very nice. Sadly they are what I would think of as kid sized, but more baby sized.",3,180
I'm getting a lot of compliments on it!,3,39
"Comfy, but see through!!!",3,25
Buen material pero muy pequeña,3,30
Surprise look closely it is one of six different sizes each.. I thought there would be a set of earrings in there of the same size but there wasn’t so look closely the product itself seems to be fine for the price,3,213
First watch had all its dials broken off. It was quickly replaced with a working watch. Nice watch thought.,3,107
"I wore this dress one time and it was nice, however, when I went to wear it a second time the zipper broke.",3,107
"Nice size and weight. Shiny gold, not matte.<br />Perfect for every day.",3,72
"This is my second time ordering these. I loved the first pair so much- I wore them out! The second pair was not the same material, they seemed a faded black and were not as breathable or flexible. I was pretty disappointed.. the only good thing about these are the length.",3,272
Not true to size. Fit a size B,3,30
The strap cracked a few days after I had it.  Wore it twice,3,59
Colors are not as pictured. They are more muted. Definitely disappointed. I wanted a nice spring colors,3,103
This did not fit my vision grill as well as I would have liked it to.  It is a little loose and moves around if I let it.  It would be better if it were more adjustable and the gripping fixtures were adjustable.,3,211
These are nice,3,14
The bottoms fit true to size. But the top is way too small. For references I'm a 34C and I was spilling out of the medium.,3,122
"I purchased the same item over a year ago and this time the sizing is off. It is too small - I can wear them, but they are tight. Disappointed.",3,143
This is a good looking hat and is well made.  It's just a bit big for my head and comes down around my ears a bit. Seems like a man-sized hat.,3,142
The size small is very large.  Was huge on our 4 year old and unusable.  Looks like it would fit a 6-8 year old. Not appropriate for toddlers so too bad they don’t have smaller sizes.,3,183
I could not see the writing on the clasp,3,40
I thought this would be much bigger. It is more of a small purse than a bag.,3,76
"Seeing as it's a compression tee, I ordered one size up, but that still wasn't enough.  Maybe it's your style, but I don't want a shirt that looks like it was painted on me.  2 sizes up would probably work nicely.",3,213
IT WAS GOOD,3,11
Fabric and color nice. Right length on my 51 frame. Tight around stomach will need shape wear.,3,94
Very cute 😚☺,3,12
Loved this dress. My students loved it!!! Light and comfortable for the constant moving of a kindergarten teacher.,3,114
Too small to fit anything.,3,26
too wide around the armpits,3,27
"Too many charms, too tight.",3,27
Pros: It doesn't feel fake and it's super soft. It was package well too.<br />Cons: The net is VISIBLE which is kind of a bummer. And yes the curls gets tangled very easily.,3,173
Hard to put on they need instructions,3,37
"This outfit is very cute, soft and comfortable. But it runs a little big. So I had to return it",3,95
It’s a faux wrap dress. It goes over your head and then comes with a tie to wrap around you to look like a wrap dress. Overall it didn’t work for me and looked horrible on,3,171
It fits good just tht I can't raise my arms. It tightens under the arms and back when I do tht.<br />I'm slightly muscular so tht may also be a reason for tht.  I think these shirts and sizes are for small slim guys. Not fat or tht of a muscular build.,3,252
Socks are so soft,3,17
Love the look and style but hated the material and returned the dress.,3,70
These are really silky and smooth.  I had a problem that they were so smooth that they just fell off.  Nothing to grip to your body with.  I hated them and returned them.  So glad they are not in my life anymore,3,211
To hard to get on and off,3,25
"Tried it on, and liked them. Put them in the wash and one of the ties is already trashed!  The metal aglet came off and the tie started to unravel. Disappointed.",3,161
Comfortable but thin material.,3,30
The blouse is pretty cute but the size was S and it fits like it was M or L,3,75
One was a size too small and the other one was bigger than what I ordered.,3,74
Button keeps popping off. Had to use gorilla glue to wear them again.,3,69
"I usually like and XL in a Jacket, but this was way to big. Shoulder and body of jacket was to large but length was fine. Love the appearance, color . Would definitely size down.",3,178
"Necklace is cheap......you get what you pay for!!! On the up side,theCharm is cute!",3,83
One of the straps broke the first time I put it on.,3,51
its a bit snug,3,14
"Okay, but would be better without the pink trim on the outside rim.",3,67
"Comfortable and soft, fit a little big.",3,39
"Gift, small",3,11
"The color was definitely OFF on this in the Pink. It was closer to a lavender, so we had to return it, unfortunately. Easy return. The quality was good, but don't choose the pink and expect a normal pink.",3,204
The top is really cute and the adjustability is great to create different styles. The bottoms are quite a bit smaller than I had anticipated and low cut. I will likely pair the top with a swim skirt,3,198
My set had 2 different designs.  One like in the photo and the other just a soft light blue with no dark blue lines.,3,116
I didn’t know it had no buttons. Would of liked to button up,3,60
The material is nice and the color is lovely too  but it’s too small. I bought 4-5T for my 3+Yr old. The shirt is fine but the pants are really small. She’s going to outgrow it even before she turns 4,3,200
This legging is about 2 inches too short. It fits good but after a few months threading came out.,3,97
Not a fan of the fit. It's boxy.,3,32
The silver part of it breaks off after sometime. I've had it for a few months now and luck for me it broke while i was at work or i would have lost my keys,3,155
They were too small for my 9 year olds face,3,43
Very cute style. Shimmery fabric is super cute and kind of thick. Has stretch but not too stretchy. Straps not adjustable. I wear a medium and this felt too tight. Fit in the chest area well but wouldn’t be good for a long torso. I will probably reorder in a large. The belt is very flattering.,3,294
Cool looking mask. It’s good for aesthetics but not for the pandemic. I have a really big face and this thing could cover my eyes and my chin at the same time.,3,159
Beautiful and soft but for their size very small.  Plus no paperwork came with them so returning was not an option.  I gave them to a local shelter.,3,148
"Great idea but way to small , not much of a give to fabric , I have small feet 6 1/2 with a bit of meat on them and just barely fit .. fabric needs more stretch",3,160
Cute frames but they were to big for my face 🤷🏻‍♀️,3,50
"Las piezas son muy bonitas, el acabado está excelente, pero lo pedí en 25mm y las que enviaron son de 30mm.",3,107
Love them but got smaller over time/washes,3,42
"The scarf is rather thin, and the filter holder started to unthread after a weeks use. It would frequently fold over and push the carbon filter out.",3,148
Received 20% off.  Just want everyone know this defective before buying.,3,72
I am 32 B and bought a medium.  It was a little tight.  The cotton is alright but not super soft.  They work well under work out shirts but I wouldn't wear them alone.,3,167
"The material is too see through, I have to wear a tank top underneath the light color topped one, the black top isn't as bad but I still have to be careful of what I have on underneath.",3,185
"The dress was cute but didn’t really look like the photos, the color was a lot different and so was the style, it was more loose fitting",3,136
"These are beyond comfortable and fit will!! I am 5'9"" got them in medium and they fit high on waist (yay!) and still reach my ankles. Im leaving 3 stars because I bought them in tie dye and they're not nearly as bright as what is pictured which is disappointing.",3,262
To small to put on Pandora charms?,3,34
My Girlfriend likes the style and the color of it. it goes with almost all the tops she owns. She looks really cuts in it,3,121
It fits okay.,3,13
i don’t like the itchy waistband Stichting. Otherwise this dress is perfect. There this thing that is super annoying: that use a fish line texture threading to sow in the tag. Super hard to get off and annoying.,3,211
like the lights- more for a child- very small and tight,3,55
"I love the dress, but the material is very thin and almost see through. You will need to wear something underneath this dress. Fits as expected though.",3,151
"I'm 5'6"" and the dress hit just below mid-calf which isn't flattering for most women. It's only for the price but I'm not in love with it.",3,138
I like everything except the two t-shirts,3,41
cute shoe but runs small and really narrow overall in shape.,3,60
"I'm 5'2&#34; about 118 lb. Bought small.<br />Little bit bulky in the weist area, how you can see it on the picture.<br />It has very strange fabric. I have the same one on my rain jacket.<br />I would return it, but it sat in my drawer for a long time",3,252
Unfortunately I bought this for a friend's birthday gift. I loved the design. But the shirt does not fit right in the chest area. I recommend layering if you wear it outside your house.,3,185
The photo more or less justify the design. However the seam on two legs are right front in the middle and you can always feel it. The material is  thin and soft and very comfortable but the seam connection right at front and yon can not ignore that sticky feeling.,3,264
"I went by the products sizing...I got a M... it fit in the chest and shoulders fine but too tight thru the waist and hips..I returned...but I loved the fabric and the style. I would definitely size up....So, I did and then.... IT WAS TOO LARGE, fit like an XL on me!",3,266
It was cute. I bought this for my boyfriend for xmas. But its a bit snug on his head.,3,85
The dress was supposed to be an XL but turned out to be more of a medium.  Crosses around my waist but not around my bust.,3,122
Dress has an odd fit. I ordered a small (5’2 135 lbs) and it was lose and tight in all of the wrong places.,3,107
"These are very very short and don't really stay in place. They basically are ""booty shorts"". They work but not particularly comfortable.",3,136
It was good<br />But the material was not good as expected,3,58
"Warmers look nice, however, I ordered coffee and grey, but received burgundy and grey.",3,86
Chinese sizing. A 3x is an xL,3,29
It fits okay and has an adjustable pull cord on the back to hold it snug on your head. The big Drake Branding emblem on the forehead needs to go.,3,145
this is a very shiny piece. It is also very light (hollow). Its worth the price but not meant for long term use,3,111
"Nice hat, but delivery took a month",3,35
"They are super cute and my daughter was so excited to get them. I thought I might have ordered wrong...but when the size 11 came for the second time, I knew it was that they didn’t send the right size (twice). So be warned....I don’t think they come in size 9 toddler!",3,268
"Nice pants but when you wash them multiple times, you realize they aren't good quality.",3,87
I love the look on the picture but the white part of the design only came up 2 inches from the bottom hem.  If it came up higher from the hem and the arms as the picture...I would have kept ir.  Wouldn't mind it if the manufacturer could try again mor like the picture.,3,269
The product looks good but better if it had rubber at both end to hold up. The black ones I tried on kept rolling up the thigh,3,126
Fits as expected. Snug fit. Soft. Durability doesn’t look promising. Not great for pressing heat transfer vinyl. Good shape. Would recommend for a cheap plain shirt for simple outfits.,3,184
The tie string broke the first time putting it on.,3,50
Nice enough but not as nice as another puma sweats I bought,3,59
The dress was a bit large for me. I am a 38DD and the top was big. I have never had this issue. Ended up returning. Originally bought for a Gala at work.,3,153
it will do,3,10
Wish I would have gotten a size down. Not really high impact for big breast. It’s comfy but if you are looking for high impact size down one. Also wish the straps were adjustable they are a little loose.,3,203
The band is very nice but the white gold is a little more tan in color. Nice option for something a little more dressy. What I didn’t like was how The magnetic end came all the way around to the other side of the watch face. I have a small wrist but didn’t see any options for a smaller band. :(,3,295
So not fit an average sized 9 year old.  These are huge,3,55
I bought this to take pictures of my son for a pregnancy announcement and they turned out super cute. It’s been washed only a couple of times and the graphic is peeling off a bit. I got my use out of it though!,3,210
"well, on the first trip one of the seams broke on one bag, and on the other a zipper.",3,85
"I liked the fabric and shine, but the size run small. I'm a US size 12, I ordered a size large and I couldn't get my leggings over my thighs. If I were to reorder I'd order a size XX.",3,183
It would be better if the brim was wider to protect your face and ears from the sun better. A lighter fabric would be cooler as well.,3,133
"These sunglasses fit great, they look nice, but the picture is a bit misleading. They're not as reflective as they look in the picture, you can still see your eyes behind the lenses",3,181
I ordered the size I usually buy.  They are too small.  Since they stretch a lot I went ahead and tried wearing a pair.  Too small.  Very disappointed.  Wish I could return them.  I would take them in size that fits.  They are soft.,3,232
Legs too short and tight.  Design is cute though,3,48
"Item arrived on time and in good condition, I only wish the length was longer, however it's still a great symbol to have.",3,121
"Very cute, but after wearing for 1 day the seam is coming apart on one, perhaps just a defective shoe. But they were reasonably priced shoes that at least worked for Easter. They are crib shoes, not meant for walking babies.",3,224
"The jacket fits okay, I just was unsatisfied with the material it was made with, but other than that it is all good. It was worth the price.",3,140
Strap was twisted and way to short for me. Returned it with no trouble.,3,71
"I have ordered another size and will be returning the original.  Loved the colors and print...but, it does not fit as expected.",3,127
I really would love to keep these but the sleeves are short and idk if they’ll shrink.,3,86
Felt very flimsy and light...couldn't tell if they would last for a while. I returned them being a Prime member.  These are truly very cheaply made glasses.,3,156
Pretty sure it says it's unisex but it is big on my head and the brim is really long. More for a man. Nice that it is waterproof and folds up nearly but rubs the top of my ears when I wear it.,3,192
Really loved the earrings. It looks better than the picture however it broke  only the second time I wore it.,3,109
Love coat but too tight ( large was very big on me) there was also whole in left pocket! I have Michael kor jacket very similar cut large fits me perfectly. ? How this could be??,3,178
Fabric was heavier than I expected and the sizing was too big. I ordered both the blue and red one and the red arrived with a small stain on it. I didn't open the packages until sometime later or I would have considered returning them.,3,235
"Nice and warm.  With the other reviews I got two sizes larger and it fits great.  The downside is that the coat only closes with snap buttons.  With alot of movement (shoveling, etc) the buttons frequently pop open.",3,215
The shirts are somehow both too small and too loose. I bought size medium and they were the length of a small but the fit of a large. Decent material but not what I was expecting. These would probably work well for someone with broad shoulders and a short torso.,3,262
Easy to unpack and put together,3,31
Good for a couple of wears. Don't expect this to be quality because it looks and feels very cheap.,3,98
"We liked it in the picture, but once on, it looked liked a dress a pilgrim would wear with the collar. We couldnt find the reciept, otherwise we would return it. We'll have to find someone to alter it to our likes.",3,214
I'm a medium and got one and it was tighter than I would have liked.,3,68
Fell apart quickly where the ribber soles are stitched.,3,55
it's a cute suit! Fits as expected. the bottoms were a little higher on my hips than expected but the suit is cute.,3,115
I followed the sellers recommendations for size/fit and they were too small. Cute shoe though.,3,94
Very pretty piece. The only issue I have it that the gold coated chipped from the post of the piece when I was cleaning it before inserting. Hopefully it won't peel any further but other than that I like the piece...very flattering.,3,232
"The watch was so pretty, however broke on me after a couple of months.  Was so disappointed",3,91
This outfit is adorable but man it is soooo thin! I guess you get what you pay for it was also so cheap. Perfect for summer I guess.,3,132
"I rated three stars as it fit somewhat small and the skirt was a odd, stiff fabric. I did the like the look , it was just hard to put on as it was a tad small.",3,159
like the feel of the fabric and dress.  The flowers were a bit too much for me but still got compliments.  thanks.,3,114
"Overall, I am not impressed. The stones look fake. The presentation and card that it arrived on looked cheap. It is stamped as being silver, but the coating is odd- not really yellow or rose gold, somewhere in the middle.<br />I would not pay $70 for this.",3,256
"It is billed as one-size-fits-all, but it doesn't.<br /><br />It is too large and lacks the elastic to fit snugly.",3,114
I was able to use a hat strecher and it now fits very nicely. Nice hat.,3,71
"Still cute, just a little too thin",3,34
Runs big. Try to downsize at least one size,3,43
"Pros- easy to adjust, fold and waterproof. Color doesn't fade.<br />cons- band gets caught on sleeves, magnetic power is low not recommended while running.",3,155
Cute shirt butbway too big!  I’ll have to send it back,3,54
This was a comfortable bra but slightly smaller than another by this company. This style just wasn't right for me since the underwire and/or fabric rubbed under my breasts. I kept the bra but I don't think I'll buy another.,3,223
runs very small but pretty,3,26
"Great size, but busted seams after 4 months of use when traveling 1-2 times/month",3,81
"Did not expect it to be a fitted hat, but it works.",3,51
I love the style of this dress. It fits the upper body very well.  PROBLEM. The flare of the dress is down to my ankles making the dress 2 feet too long.  Plus the  stretchy nylon thread is coming loose in the front.  Very disappointed.,3,236
2x NOT super large as I'd hoped.  Blue/black has black neckline edging unlike photo.  Will keep as fabric is nice - just won't wear as big vest type overshirt.,3,159
I loved these devil horns! I bought them for my Devil Halloween costume and I was very happy with the fit and material. They are durable but a bit flimsy. Wish the material was shinier and that there were hair clips to hold into my hair better. This would have been a plus for me.,3,280
Was this supposed to be just one piece or two?...I just got the sweat shirt.,3,76
It’s fitted on my 15 month old. Definitely needs more accurate sizing.,3,70
"Chain broke, but my daughter loves the charm.",3,45
"The pendant is  pretty but just a bit big.  The chain is pretty too, but the nickel in it really reacts to my skin and it stinks.  Can't  use the chain.  Nevertheless, with St Patrick's Day coming, I'm glad I got it.",3,216
"Okay, nothing special.  I tried 38 c (one of the highest sizes available) which ended up being loose for someone who is normally a D size. Style wasn't anything great but a good price for what I got.",3,199
"I’ve only been wearing this for a few months and somehow this piece in the clasp has popped out and been totally rusted around the edges.<br /><br />It does rub against my wrist and chafe if I wear it too long, but it has a good hold through intense workouts.",3,259
Cute pieces but a few have already broke so not happy about that,3,64
It will work. The leather is very thin but good for the price.,3,62
"if you have a killer shape which I don't you might like it, I should have read better. I thought it was cotton and would  hang on my body. instead it hugs every part of your body. I wear in house away from others eyes, and try not pass a mirror,lol.",3,249
I thought it would be higher quality since it's the most expensive rubber ring.  It came scuffed.  It's OK I suppose but in hindsight I would have purchased the less expensive versions with multiple rings which had high reviews.  Nothing special about this Kauai ring.,3,268
"Just opened box, can see border stitching is coming off of belt, with thread/material peeling.  Doesn’t appear to be used, so build quality comes into question.  When I open a box I’d at least want it to look like.  Other than the issues I described functionality wise...it’ll hold your pants up.",3,296
Honestly isn’t the safest option. I used it as my first binder but after awhile it started to get holes and the material would fray and pieces would go into my skin and I would have to dig them out almost like a black head. You really get what you pay for with binders so try gc2b or underworks even.,3,300
Tried a medium and large...the chest part it just too big. You need boob tap but then you can't get the top down. Cute if you can make it work but i was not able to.,3,165
The dress is really cute.  The girls liked it.  But first time worn the skirt tore at the waist.  She is not a rough and tumble girl.<br /> Just fragile material.  It tore while she was taking it off.,3,200
The quality of the belt for the price was a good value.  I did return this belt because it was more narrow than I'm used to wearing.  I am a big man with a 58&#34; waist and when I tried it on i felt like my pant waist was rolling over the top.  I think a big guy needs more width in a belt.,3,291
"Pretty, but overpriced.",3,23
It's a pretty band but the clasp is difficult to open/close.,3,60
"Before I had a chance to use them, the rubber pads on the temples fell off.",3,75
Very pretty but if ur sensitive to fake jewelry be careful you will get an allergic reaction.,3,93
"Bought these in Flesh & Bone and Bionic. Material was a little thinner than expected (thought it would be more workout pant material), but it'll do the job. I'm 5'3&#34; and 143 lbs. and ordered a XS/S which was still a little loose on me, especially around the calf/ankle area.",3,278
"overall, I like it",3,18
They where all cut different,3,28
"Cheaper than I wanted, but i expected that based on the reviews. It was wearable for a few times..",3,98
Way too short on the length athough not exposing my waist I would really like it longer to near hips,3,100
It doesn't look exactly like the pic as mentioned in a previous review.  Also the charcoal filter is useless because you cannot breathe through the filter.  Your breath just goes around the filter but its still a cool mask.,3,223
These leg warmers are okay.  They're well made but they were a bit shorter than what I wanted.,3,94
really cute jacket but was wayyy too small for me. im a size small and ordered a small. Im 5'3 and 125 pounds. the sleeves were wayy too short and i could barely zip the jacket at all. cute to re-gift though or donate to someone else.,3,234
These are better suited for adults.,3,35
"I followed the size chart and this shirt was just too small. I have plenty of rolls and flub, just had baby number 4 a few months ago, but I took that into account when ordering. It was cute, the graphic was printed well, the material was acceptable for the price. Just to darn small!",3,284
Was not as thick as I was expecting.  Very pretty colors though.,3,64
"I like this dress a lot; the reason I didn't give more stars was because the company screwed up the order, and I had to wait 19 days for the correct one to arrive. This is a good buy, if you're not in any particular hurry to get the product.",3,241
"Fits well but the waist is a little too high, for me. Overall a good product.",3,77
They were more pink than red,3,28
Kind of small for my head but they work.,3,40
"Hat is super cute, however it was squished into a ball for shipping. once unfolded you can see all the creases it left in the hat. I'm hoping they will work them selves out before our pictures!",3,193
Was a little bit more snug then I was anticipating based off of the sizing feedback posted. It's nice enough - especially for the price - but the pattern wasn't exactly what I was anticipating.,3,193
The tail was awesome but the matching ears are just glued onto a Bobby pin.,3,75
"The quality of the jumper itself is very nice. However, their sizing chart and customer advice is way off. According to the chart I bought a large and two of me could have fit in it. So be aware they run large.",3,210
"Nice looking, but does not fit my wrist.  Only made for small people.",3,69
This was great for one night the straps on the top broke off I can still use it tho and the bottoms are see thru,3,112
Little to small,3,15
Not as nice as the picture but I kept it,3,40
Small was to big on my chest I’m 34C,3,36
Fit was great but faded after 2 washes.,3,39
I wanted to wear this on hot summer days. I had to return this dress because the small was too big.,3,99
I would have returned this item but I passed the deadline. Not a bad pants bottom but the fit just didn't match my style like I hoped for.,3,138
"I wanted to like this dress, but the style was just not flattering on me. I'm 5'2&#34; and it didn't hang right. Maybe if I was taller?? I sent it back and didn't order a smaller size.",3,184
The material and fabric was awesome…. But the length definitely came up short … no pun intended … Lol not a little above the ankles .<br />I’m 5’6,3,146
"The dress is of nice quality and looks cute but the collar part is loose and if you have a big chest the dress might be tight in that area. Also the arms is quite tight. Basically if you have a large chest or big arms, I recommend sizing up by one.",3,248
Cute but the holes on the sleeves are way smaller than on the picture. And its tight around the chest area,3,106
The straps for the leg wraps to attach could be made better. Also could be made a littler thicker. But overall it works for the money,3,133
Loved the color but the fit was really boxy.  The material was very thick too.,3,78
I didn't realize it didn't come with the cheatsheets.,3,53
"It runs small, especially in the arms. It's a great product but you need to size up",3,83
Uncomfortable but that’s to be expected,3,39
watch is very large but is a good-looking watch band is very stiff and quite uncomfortable otherwise not a bad product for the price,3,132
Warm.  Just very hard to get them on,3,36
"Not my favorite bra. I prefer padding (which this doesn't have), and it really wasn't the most comfortable even though the support was decent",3,141
The teal is more blueish turquoise. Definitely not teal!,3,56
"Beautiful, but I returned it because it was too big.",3,52
Neck isn’t as wide as pic. Tight crew. Fits smaller,3,51
There really big,3,16
Odd fit and I didn’t love the wine color.,3,41
"Almost too small, other than that it's a great hat!",3,51
"Fun, easy hat. Bought in black. Very comfortable but faded so quickly and really lost a decent shape after a couple weeks.",3,122
I bought this shirt and it’s definitely more a fitted style. I agree with sizing up. I wore it to a friends and everyone noticed that the pocket was not placed in the correct place and sideways a little. I couldn’t return because I had already washed it and wore it.,3,266
"It was exactly how I wanted to look; however, it broke almost immediately after wearing it a few times.",3,103
I actually loved this one piece. Not sure about the sizing however the large didn’t fit so I ended up gifting it.,3,113
"Sizes run super small my son 5 yrs old  have no room inside the shoe , size 12 was too small compare to is regular shoe wich is 11 or 12 sizes.",3,143
Its alright but not that helpful.,3,33
"Would like to send them back, but I can give to granddaughter.",3,62
"These are functional enough, but a bit hard and so slightly uncomfortable to walk around in.  Good enough for my needs of wearing while I take out the trash, but I wouldn't be so sure about wearing long term.",3,208
Cute shirt but it’s nice and stretchy so the buttons do not stay buttoned.,3,74
"threads coming out of seams, cheap looking, not a premium quality product. However fits and feels allright",3,106
Lighter color than expected and too small in the arms.,3,54
"The support with this is not great, and my right breast slips out a bit often. I'm not a huge fan of the design overall, however it is very soft and I do use it. I'm an F cup, so there aren't a ton of options.",3,209
"The hip is wider than I expected.. The material is not what is shown on the website . I was going to return it because it is not suitable for the purpose i bought it for, but I am keeping it because I can wear it to church.",3,223
"Sticks and holds very well. Just remember, they can only do so much and if you have large breasts you may not get the desired results.",3,134
much longer than I thought,3,26
4t is way too short for a 4 year old. Read the product description before purchase. It does say it's not 100% cotton and it's comfortable but I didn't like the cloth and cant let my daughter wear it.,3,199
way small,3,9
These are well-made gloves and they might be rain resistant but they are not waterproof by any stretch of the imagination,3,121
"This hat would be cute, if it was much smaller.  Not because it fits too big, it's a huge hat!  I looked like a baby in it!",3,123
The quality and material was great and I really wanted to like it. After putting it on it was very itchy and uncomfortable.,3,123
"These REVS are really a fun color.  Sorry to say, they run very narrow.",3,71
"I’ve only had them for about two weeks their cheap, you get what you paid for but there very cute and stylish",3,109
Way more tight than the other brands in men's medium,3,52
"Cute dress that I used through my pregnancy. It didn't wash very well, and showed a lot of where even after a couple washes. Thankfully it was cheap enough that I didn't care, and only used it temporarily during my second and third trimester pregnancy. Cute with leggings!",3,272
Cheap but fun.,3,14
Warm jacket but to wear only at home or around...not for going out because it look cheap enough.,3,96
"The quality is good, but it runs really small in the hips.  An extra large typically fits really well, if not a bit loose, but I couldn’t even button the bottom two buttons!",3,173
One of the shoes came apart and I only had them for about 3 months. They are NOT<br />very strong at all!,3,105
Wasn’t true to size I ordered a 3x and fit like a large,3,55
I found the fit everywhere except the arm holes good.  I found it cut into my armpits at the shoulder blade level.  the top portion cup fit the broadness of the shoulder blades did not.,3,185
"Material is polyester & spandex, a very &#34;limp&#34; fabric. Good for a &#34;cover up&#34; over a bathing suit or such...",3,123
See through at the top,3,22
"They look and feel like $8 sunglasses. Not very comfortable, but not terrible either.",3,85
Pourly made,3,11
They're tight but I guess that's for a reason. It is not soundproof but it does mute the sounds to an acceptable level for a baby. I let my son wear his at the races and they are great for him. But sometimes I feel bad about how tight they are.,3,244
My wife thought they would be thicker.,3,38
No era la tela esperada,3,23
Nice Quality but threads are coming out.,3,40
"I love the color and the cut but I have a long torso, it's too short for my body",3,80
Posts were both on the same antler for each earring...made one look like it was laying funny.,3,93
Didn't fit right,3,16
Do not like material.,3,21
"Bought this to groom my dogs in. Works well, however the button broke off after 2 uses and the loop to hang it up came undone",3,125
"I was really hoping this leotard would be great, but it looks very cheap. The color is great, but the tutu color is off.  I would not say that it’s a good value for the price.",3,175
"Not a true size, fit a bit snug and my breast was overflowing.",3,62
The picture shows a very loose leg. I found it to be narrower than expected. The hips are snug. I weigh 145 size 10-12 and if I had to do it again I would buy an XL. The fabric is on the cheap side. I haven’t washed it yet so I can’t comment on that.,3,250
"Cute shirt, but way too small.  Will not fit once I wash it :(",3,62
It is really cheap looking and nylony!  I am only using this for a fun 1920's party so not too worried.  Would never wear this as actual clothing.,3,146
shirts shrinks after wash,3,25
The dress is OK for the price.,3,30
"my favorite relax shoe, but please store them so that they don't get so crumpled before delivery . it takes a while regain form, mine has not yet.",3,146
"It was easy to attach, but too big for my wrist with no way to adjust it. Looks nice on the watch",3,97
Thin is the best way to describe the material.  But that's what I was expecting.,3,80
A little flimsy. Mine got caught on something and bent and fell off,3,67
"Thought it was more of a cotton material. But it's that stretchie thin stuff that shows every flaw, color was good",3,114
"fabric soft, just smaller than average for a medium",3,51
The zipper seemed to have been disconnected. Haven't even used it yet. Will see if it will travel well.,3,103
My son loves the sweater.,3,25
"Arrived very quickly, they are very comfortable but the fabric tore above and below the back pocket the 2nd time they were worn.",3,128
This jersey was way to small I ordered a 4xl and it at best a 2xl but that being said it is made well and seems rugged I just wish it fit lol!,3,142
"Fabric wrinkles very easily. Ironed and within minutes they were back where the dress draped. Fits slightly snug. I followed the sizing guide to order my size, but the fabric does stretch... the low stars are for the maintenance of the fabric...",3,245
"The earrings and my ear lobes turned green after a short time wearing them. I love them, but am far too allergic to wear them for more than 20 minutes. Don't buy if you have any allergies to jewelry.",3,199
"Pretty itchy, but made it through a night of Halloween adventures.  But was so grateful to get it off at the end of the night.",3,126
Runs extremely small but very cute. Will gift them.,3,51
Pro<br />-warm & comfortable<br /><br />Con<br />-it picks up a TON of lint and can get itchy if you don't take the time to lint roll it,3,136
"Works well to prop collar up but fit isn’t precise as the tips stick out and are visible (had to break the edges off). Could be because I wear predominately spread collars, not sure.",3,182
I really like this shirt but after one washing noticed small whole near hem. Maybe OK if you hand wash this shirt every time and putting in washing machine was not a good idea. It was cheap so...,3,195
fit quite small,3,15
"OK but they pill quickly.  Not smooth enough on skin.  But in a pinch and cold out, I wear them.",3,96
"I was hoping for more of a swing-type top that was flowy around the hips, but this wasn't. I even ordered a size up from my usual size, but the fabric has no stretch and it just bunched near the hips. Cute shirt, but not for me.",3,228
The fit on this shirt is off.,3,29
Wouldn’t order again. Wash them a FEW times before wear. No matter what the baby will have black fuzz between their toes. Also. The writing on the bottom of the foot is weird. Wish it was just dots or something.,3,211
"Good quality for the price. Fingertips are too long for my 3yr olds hands (by approx. 3/4&#34;) but, she loves them.",3,116
"When I tried to put these on my eyeglasses, the clips didn't fit correctly, so I tried to bend one of the clips slightly to get it to fit better.  Unfortunately the clip snapped off, making the sunglasses unusable, so I can't judge how well they would have worked.",3,264
"It's shines very well. But it just looks fake, like it's bought from a 25 cent machine.",3,87
Supposed to be grey but it more purple. But otherwise its fine.,3,63
These shirts run super small group a size or maybe 2 if you dont want snug fit,3,78
Super cute and great material! But I ordered a large and I’m a bit busty and it was a bit tight,3,95
Too tight in my arms. Not much stretch in the material. Otherwise it's okay.,3,76
Can see through in sunlight. Don't wear outside!,3,48
The backpack is cute but the white little bear came right off after using it for the first time,3,95
"Too small, had to return",3,24
I bought them as a Christmas gift for my husband thinking large would fit. They seem to run small so he gave them to our teenaged  grandson. They’ll probably only fit this one season.,3,183
Too tight at the neck,3,21
The product isn't bad they stay lit up but the only problem is you can't pick the color you want and I ended up getting pink ones and i hate the color pink but I guess they work tho.,3,182
Nice gloves but too big for my small hands,3,42
"Fits like a glove and hugs your foot if you have good arches. Very comfortable, I wear all the time not just for showering. Only issue is the nubs on the bottom are wearing fast.",3,178
I’m 5 ft 2 and the leggings fell right above my ankle. I’d prefer they be about an inch longer. 1st time worn they ran in the back and that really sucked because I was so excited for these leggings. They’re not sweat proof but I do like the thickness and color.,3,261
"Runs small. Maybe OK if flat tummy. I have the mommy tummy budge, Normally size 10-12 and it normally hides that, however the 2X doesn't.",3,137
Thinner than I had expected.,3,28
"I ordered one in white and one in gray, both smalls. The white one has significantly shorter sleeves than the gray one which fits perfectly. Inconsistent sizing.",3,161
So far so good,3,14
FIT WAY TO SMALL,3,16
It was too chunky for a size 5 finger. Good price and about average workmanship.,3,80
"Cute, buy one of the clear nose pieces was missing upon receiving it.",3,69
"Nice gloves for the price. Yes, there is a smell problem so don't expect to wear them at least a week, because you might need like a week to air it out. Overall it was not a disappointing buy.",3,192
Glasses will be fun for occasional use but are not very sturdy.  They were priced low and so did not expect to get premium quality product.,3,139
I bought this because it looked cute but it was a little too large a fot,3,72
Nice vest . I ordered a large which I received but it fit like a small. Reordered a XXXL and it fit just fine.,3,110
"&#34;no water bottle pocket&#34; or  loop for hook hanging, two large compartments for racket and gear, but no inner pockets for small items. sturdy material and really cute.....",3,178
"The short was a little tighter than I had envisioned, but still fits comfortably and didn't restrict my workout at all. I love how quirky it is :)",3,146
This skirt fits as expected. Pattern is nice… but the elastic it has at the waist is one of those thin and flimsy ones that bends all over the place after just one wear and then it never goes back to normal. It’s pretty annoying… I really wanted to love this skirt,3,264
Top was slightly tight on the bottom band and bottoms fit well. Not the most flattering set ive bought but does the job. As fashion goes horizontal stripes does make a body look more plump. But after the long wait of about 5 weeks it showed up and it comfortable.,3,263
"I love the idea, I like the beanie. But my left headphone is busted. It buzzes. Sounds like something is rattling in it. I want to use these but it's very annoying.",3,164
Very hard to screw in. I still can't wear it.. Instead of the little ball screwing off the top like others do... You have to unscrew it from the middle ball right above the bow and it's way too difficult to screw on while in your naval....,3,239
The band is falling apart but the watch case is doing well,3,58
These aren't the best but also aren't the worst. Good value for the price. Fit as expected...but the legs kept riding up most of the day. I annoyingly had to adjust them throughout the day.,3,189
I did not think the item was as nice as pictured. Hem uneven.,3,61
Very pink.,3,10
A stretch to call these “wool” Sox...,3,37
Watch does not shine like picture on line,3,41
Its beautiful but my goodness I'm not sure if ill ever be able to wear it.,3,74
Love the colors  just too small to get over my breast size D  cup . Gave to my daughter  size B cup fit here fine . She wears small to medium on tops . I wear large on tops .,3,174
"These fit fine, but offer no support whatsoever. I'm keeping them to wear over my bra under some sheer tops or just around the house.",3,133
"I'm 5'4&#34;, am a 42C, and weight about 180ish and it's a little bit tight on me.",3,82
Too large and had to return.,3,28
"These are pantyhose, not tights, and very see-through at that. Will have to get a nude color to go underneath or just an entire new pair all together.",3,150
Not the quality I was expecting.  Looked already worn out when I got it.,3,72
"Excellent product, eye catching and conversation piece...",3,57
Shirt is good quality and I like the fabric. I ordered a size under my usual and it is still really large. I would not purchase again.,3,134
"Sexy coverup. I do like it a lot. Been on two trips already.  I say it fits small, more so because of the length. It may only come halfway down my butt. And the idea is to cover up. If it were a little longer, and there was a sleeveless version, I'd have multiples in different colors!",3,285
"This wasn't as stretchy as I thought they'd be so if you order, I'd go up a size. It's really pretty though and if it was the right size, it would be perfect!",3,158
"too large, and the main problem is that the brim is out of scale....so even you have big head this hat is gonna look very weird on you.",3,135
Slips off my heel.,3,18
"Sizing seemed way too small. I bought a Size 5 for my son to replace his 4.5. These size 5 were the same size as his 4.5's. So buy a whole size big and you should be okay. Seemed like a decent cleat, but just too small.",3,219
"I like that its very large, it just seems that i have to put a lot of pressure behind the rub to actually get my silver shining.",3,128
Not to flattering,3,17
It is a comfortable alternative to wearing a bra around the house. They do run a bit on the small side but is still comfortable. I wouldn't find them comfortable enough to sleep in. They wash well and they wear well,3,215
They tore after wearing them for less than a month. The strap didn't fit properly. It was too loose and didn't hold my foot in place at all. Even though I got my correct size ny foot slid around the house shoe like crazy. But besides that it was comfortable to a certain degree while it lasted.,3,294
As described. Sometimes slips above my shoe in the back making it hard to keep them unseen.,3,91
"After one washing, had to sew side seams just below waist band.",3,63
"they barely float, and they slip off of my glasses sometime, design is cool and comfy",3,85
"Is pretty lackluster.<br />The diamonds and amethyst don’t sparkle at all.<br />Even though it lacks the sparkle I want, it is still pretty for costume jewelry.",3,160
"Its fits as expected. I really like the look and works great in hot weather. However, there's an unusual amount of fuzz that comes off the socks after wearing it. Its almost a disgusting amount.",3,194
"Bought these for my child because she likes my Ray-Ban Aviators.  They’re decent sunglasses for the price, but they were a good bit lighter than my Ray-Bans.",3,157
Ordered the same on in a different color. It fit great. This one was listed as the same size and was way to big.,3,112
"Smell is funny but after washed, it is ok.  Disappointed in the fit, it runs small so I had to order a second one and now I have 2.",3,131
"A great deal for the money as it is a very pretty scarf, but it comes all the way from China and it took three weeks to get here.",3,129
Don’t darken at all,3,19
Skirt was very similar to the picture. Very professional looking I like the length. The fabric was nice. But it ran small and very narrow.,3,138
Love them but they run a little small.,3,38
Cute but to small for me.,3,25
"You are getting what you paid for, the item does feel a bit cheap but what can you say, it was for a cheap price so it was to be expected... I really wish they had a full tint red shades or maybe a full tint red shades that tints from red to black.",3,248
"A little too big, I should have sized down",3,42
"Cute, colorful and I get lots of compliments on it, but runs a bit big I think.",3,79
"Liked the fabric and color but was a little strange fitting around the middle. Higher and bulkier than the picture. Could just be meant for a different body type. 5’3, 118 lbs.",3,176
"nice BIG hat, but very floppy, cant wear to keep sun off face while working, better for fashion statement than practical use",3,124
"These shoes are tiny, I got them for my 4 year old for a dance class but they smell really bad and the size is way off so beware before you buy.",3,144
"They run small, and are not quite as &#34;cushy&#34; as I'd hoped. But it will break the wind from slicing through. Seems pretty well made.",3,139
"This top is adorable but not what bra I wear you can see the imprint through the top. I even ordered a size up, but nothing worked.",3,131
The size was very small. I think these errings are meant for children not adults.,3,81
Did not like how it hung on my body. I recommend sizing up. I did and it fit just fine. Just didn’t like it for me.,3,115
"The top fit perfectly, the bottoms were huge!",3,45
They fit as expected,3,20
No tiene mucho agarre.,3,22
No es facil de poner en los zapatos,3,35
"After reading reviews,  I ordered 2 sizes up.  There is not a lot of support, when I lay down or lean forward,  they fall out.",3,126
I like the bag but the straps are too short.,3,44
Kind of larger for a Pandora bracelet and the two pieces do not fit close together like it appears in the picture.,3,114
"It is slightly thin, be ready to accompany it with another long sleeve shirt underneath in freezing temperatures.  Besides that, it serves it purpose greatly.",3,158
Cute style like ray bans and it bended quick just for few days of use.,3,70
"Nice product, but could be a bit longer",3,39
I love it but I recommend getting a size up it runs small but it's very nice and soft worth the price just get a size up,3,120
"Bigger than I expected, so I'll have to dig out the mulch to hide it.",3,69
Pretty rings but the stones have a very unnatural fake color and the inside wording is crooked while you have to look extremely close to see the names.,3,151
This shirt is very cute but TINY. Go up a size if you want to button it!,3,72
"I do like the fabric and the print. The dress does not look good with my body type, maybe better for a taller person. I'm 5'3.",3,126
Did not fit well so we returned them,3,36
Back zipper ripped away from seam .. a good 3&#34; .. after 2 weeks.. did not over stuff ..,3,91
Front lifeguard patch was hanging loose,3,39
I love the beautifully large logo on these pants but i found them to be a bit to large to be a medium women and oddly wide at the hips though they are somewhat comfy the material is a bit thinner than what i would have liked. I wish they were thicker.,3,251
Very pretty dress but very thin and see-through.,3,48
Just did t look right.  Cute though.,3,36
The body suit was nice but runs way too small...I ordered a medium which is my usual size and it was not typical medium. Disappointed and had to return.,3,152
Top fit is awkward,3,18
"VERY shiny and you really can't beat the price. I will say that it is kind of cheap looking if you're up close. The white under the diamonds is a lot more noticeable in person, and the diamonds are a LOT more spaced out than in the picture. Other than that, good buy. My mom loves it.",3,284
"These hats are adorable but they run very small, more for kids than adults",3,74
Cute design but ran small even going up a size.,3,47
"It is very supportive around my chest but I was thinking I was buying something that would help with my posture. Will I still use the bra? Yes, but not for what I bought it for.",3,177
"Nice bracelet, the clasp is the issue for me , almost impossible for one person to hook on wrist. Needs modification or a different design for clasp!!!",3,151
"Does not fit at waist, as the photo suggest",3,43
Color was more beigy than cognac.. othee than that.. good quality,3,65
Love love love. Very sexy,3,25
"Bought this and it seemed wonderful, at first, but the wire to the little onion broke.  Luckily, I was in my house so it happened there and I found the little onion as it rolled under the vanity!  Not sure how or who can fix it.",3,228
"Fits a bit large, so order a size down. This is a spring top since the material is very thin. It wrinkles very easily and is a bit of chore to keep iron due to all of lace. There were many, many strings to cut at first, as well.",3,228
"The gems are nice and the right size but the shaft is too long for ears, unless you have really fat ears. And they seems to be 18g which makes the threads on the head too small for my 16g posts.",3,194
This shirt looks and feels like it was made with some sort of super cheap fabric.  Not at ALL what I thought I was purchasing based on the price.  It is so sheer you can clearly see right through it.  VERY disappointed!,3,219
Very big on top (even for being busty) the arm hole is very large so if you wear a bra it will show. Long enough though to be modest,3,132
I ordered the suit as someone with a larger past thinking the extra material would help to be able to cover and it did not. I will keep the suit because after removing the pads and loosening the straps I can make it work but I wish it was just a little bit bigger.,3,264
Very stretchy material and I where near as long as pictured on model. She must be 5'3 or smaller for it to be that long.,3,120
I usually wear a large but ordered X-large. It fits like a medium,3,65
Earrings are cute and big but broke on the first day.,3,53
"Comfortable, cute, & you can wear just this & I love it. The straps are REALLY thin so they’re starting to fray unfortunately",3,125
"Really short, otherwise nice, comfy",3,35
I wanted this for a church program and it was a bit loud. This is more for a tuxedo and not an every day occasion.,3,114
"the length is ok but the strap is way too large, feeling disappointed.",3,70
"very thin, but soft and decently long",3,37
Lovely dress.,3,13
Nice design but super long,3,26
Painful to wear for more then 5 minutes,3,39
"The fabric was extremely cheap and rather thin. I thought it would be more of a cotton/linen material, but it was actually a stretchy spandex blend.",3,148
looks good and working fine,3,27
"Cute, though nothing special. They get the job done.",3,52
"Not on par with citizen, we’ll have to do for the price.",3,56
This looks and feels great but it's too small!,3,46
It's a cute outfit but the material is thick to wear in summer.,3,63
I wear a large and it was just way too small. Soft material but cotton and seemed like it would shrink even more.,3,113
"I bought the 12-18 mon size and the shoe was too small, not for chubby feet.",3,76
"these are a good slipper. they can not be washed though. I washed them and they fell apart. :( but, before they fell apart they were great.",3,139
The bag is an ok size. The handles aren't long enough. The description definitely does not say the inside fabric of the black bag is brown. The bag definitely stinks as other people commented. Due to the handle length and inside fabric color I returned the bag.,3,261
I think they are made for Chinese heads.  A Bit tight.,3,54
"I am 5'1 around 140 lbs and a 34D (i have curves, im not fat) The 2XL is slightly too small, doesnt not provide the coverage i was expecting. Also, not as cute as i was expecting but is still cute",3,196
"It is a decent belt, kinda stylish.",3,35
I guess these would work for heavy boot socks in the middle of Antarctica...but they are thick and they go above my knees. They are pretty hilarious. I did not return bc I tried them on...but won't be wearing them except as a joke I guess?,3,239
Not as baggy as shown on the model,3,34
A regular clasp or lobster hook would have been better/more secure in genuine silver. Color of pearls are nice. Took some time to arrive,3,136
Seems to run big but it works,3,29
Nice but are too big around the waist and are not adjustable,3,60
The material was a little  too flimsy..but other than that I love it!,3,69
As expected they snag easily.  They are what I expected.  Not bad if you know it will happen and you don't plan on using them every day,3,135
"This dress is incredibly beautiful.  The fabric is thick and the dress is well made.  While the dress fit at the chest and waist, it is definitely made for tall girls.  There was some weird bunching and poofing out in weird places, which made this dress not flattering for short people.",3,286
Too big for my head I had to give them away,3,43
"I was happy when this came in the mail especially since it came in time for our camping trip.  First day though the zipper messed up, but I was able to fix it.  And every once in a while it comes off the track.  It's not for everyday use so that doesn't bother me so much.",3,272
Super cute! But was way too big for my wrist!,3,45
It’s definitely a warm vest without using the battery but the wires seem to bend to easy and now it doesn’t stay on. Not worth the price for that.,3,146
Soft material. Order up a size or two depending on how snug you want it to be. Could be a bit longer but can still wear as dress or with leggings.,3,146
Slightly smaller than I usually wear. Would order one size larger. Good quality shirt though. I am just going to wear it open with t underneath.,3,144
This piece was Not worth the price of the item.,3,47
My 15 month old regular sized baby is so comfy in these. No more slipping about on the wood floors in socks. Would recommend them. The sock part is showing wear and we haven't had them for long but I expected that considering the price.,3,236
I really liked this bag but....2 days past the return date the zipper came apart and is not fixable.,3,100
this wallet has a strong odor,3,29
Product as seen in picture. Might need to steam before wearing.,3,63
I would have liked a smaller size but............it will work.,3,62
I ordered my size and it was kind of big I wear a medium size I'm about 140 lb and I'm five six and it didn't really fit like the picture but I made it work 😊,3,158
"They don't stay on the bottoms of my feet very well, and they stretch out easily and move around in my boots, so they don't really protect my feet from my boots, but they are super warm, and super cute on and oh my gosh are they soft! i just wish they didn't stretch out so much.",3,279
"Cute for the time being yet, the top layer does come off easily",3,63
"Way to long, bought it to wear around the house.",3,48
I've had purse about two weeks and strap has already fallen off.  I like the purse and hope that by putting it back on it will stay. Leather is decent for the price. Did not receive it on date I was a guaranteed though.,3,219
Love the colors but the little piece that holds the excess band broke on the very first day...,3,94
+Good sized brim<br />+ponytail hole<br />+ lightweight<br /><br />-neck flap ridiculously small<br />-tad snug on my giant (24”) head<br />-Did not give you a choice of colors,3,176
I really loved this belly jewelry and was very disappointed when all of the silver basically rubbed off to reveal a lower quality metal with a different color.  Only the bar is surgical steel.  Not worth the price but great design.  Very disappointed and won’t be purchasing again.,3,281
They are pretty fantastic. However one of the swtiches takes two hard presses to turn on the lights 2 days after arriving.,3,122
"Love the quality, just a little shorter than I expected.",3,56
The gloves fit well but the mitten part is extra long for someone with small hands,3,82
"kinda cheap, broke while i was trying to take it off, but its very pretty",3,73
I wish this were longer through the torso but it’s wearable.,3,60
"Bought my husband a large tall. Fits perfect, He Is 6'4'' And Weighs 190.  Is not worth $110 as it didn't keep him warm for a undershirt.  It's no better than regular long underwear.",3,182
"It's definitely shorter than the pictures show, and I'm only 5'2""",3,65
Cute shrug but fit needs to be better.  I guess I needed to order a smaller size.  It’s rather boxy.,3,100
NICe look but cheaply made,3,26
"Discolored rubber panels underneath the design. Not too noticeable but since it’s for an Apple watch that’s waterproof, it should be waterproof too. I think it got discolored while washing dishes. Apple Watch is fine!  Solved problem by peeling off the panels and it still looks great.",3,285
Ring looks actually like pictures. It’s nice just wish it wasn’t so thin and fragile. Other than that i love it.,3,112
"[[VIDEOID:eda486919eac0c86f3e5ea1c58996e23]] Not all of them can fit my ear, but they are cute",3,94
Decent quality for the price.,3,29
Broke easily.,3,13
Cute dress but it’s real see through.,3,37
The alarm stopped working.,3,26
Too small for 4x. Not the true size.,3,36
"Great style, but doesn't prevent air from entering into eyes.  Poor fit!",3,72
I ordered a large in this and it is definitely too small to wear as a Shackett. I normally wear a medium to large and a top. If you are a large you might want to get it ask our even a two XL if you want this to be a shack it and not a fitted shirt.,3,248
Was a lot smaller than expected and did not fit my daughter. Def order a few sizes up. It was a really nice shirt though...,3,123
We will see how long this lasts. Very thin.,3,43
"Ordered these for work, Material was very thin so there is not structure to the pant, one pocket was sew poorly leaving pleats at the top making the pant lay weird when on. Nothing exceptional to these pants. Still deciding if I should return them.",3,248
I expected two pair !!!!! as shown,3,34
Pretty top but very thin material,3,33
"It’s the perfect length in the front, but the back is longer than i was expecting.  Super comfy",3,95
"I wear a large in just about everything I order.  The reviews said that the jacket runs small, so I ordered a 3XL just to be safe.  The jacket was still way too small, I gave it to my 12 year old daughter.  Do not buy unless you are a naturally petite person.",3,259
Bought this for my daughter.  It &#34;fits&#34; but is too tight but the quality and fabric was really nice so I am ordering the next size up.,3,142
Pretty but too heavy - kept falling out of my hair,3,50
"Belt looks very fancy and nice, but husband has had it for about a month and it already has decent wear on it. Probably wouldn't order again.",3,141
Era para mi madre le quedó muy pequeño ! Esta lindo pero para persona flaca,3,75
It fits tight in the arms unlike the first and third ones I purchased and it has a strong chemical smell to it unlike the other two I've purchased.,3,147
the elastic waistband is too tight and uncomfortable,3,52
I know these are wholesale random docks but I received a large portion of weird pastel green socks with unflattering accent like brown and mint green. A lot are very thin socks too. Its definitely a gamble.,3,206
Got it as a gift for my roommate and it hasn't broken after multiple uses,3,73
I like that they got here before they were supposed  too but I don't think there supposed to be cracked or have long scratchs across them their smooth but u can feel the he'll out of the scratch and cracks.,3,206
I am a US 12 and this looks like a US 6.,3,40
"I love the leggings, but I ordered them with pockets and they have no pockets. I cannot give 5 stars on something I did not receive.",3,132
"Fit is fair except for the very tapered leg (too tight at the hem), washability is great, plenty of pockets.<br />I would wish for a wider leg at the bottom",3,156
Two of the 10 were not what I was expecting... But the rest were great.,3,71
These break really easily.,3,26
Okay Already REALLY super fitted and CAP FLAP TOO ROUND,3,55
Little small. I’m 5’11 145 lbs. male,3,36
"Nice looking sunglasses, Only downside is you can still see through from this glass and see my original glass",3,109
"The charm is nice, but the chain cannot be sterling silver, tarnished bad",3,73
"I am 5'8 and I ordered a medium - it's huge....  I would have been much happier with a small.  Also - the fabric is weird - not cotton, polyester.",3,146
the golden buttons and blue ones werent there lol,3,49
I didn't realize it was a full zip when I ordered it,3,52
Just okay. Was listed as hitting below the knee but actually stops at knee...I'm short and should not have this problem!,3,120
Very snug in the toe area!  Beautiful shoe!,3,43
Not to be used for kits of walking. Best as a house shoe or a go to the grocery store type of shoe.<br />I am on my feet all day and the soles almost completely fell off. I have duct tape holding the shoes to the soles,3,218
Love the look- was hurting after a few hours,3,44
I like the belt but the color of the brown belt and the coffee belt were the same color - more of a dark tan. I can't use it for the outfit I bought it for. The delivery took almost 8 weeks.,3,190
"I ordered these for my daughter for her Easter outfit, they are SO big!  I ordered the size that she measures as, they were too long in the foot and the straps were HUGE tightening the buckle to the smallest hole did nothing to help. She is heartbroken that I had to send them back :(",3,284
This is cute but I’m considering taking in the part when a small piece of plastic is permanently holding the fabric between the two cups together. Perhaps it would fit much better if it was just sewn instead,3,207
Runs really big at the waist,3,28
"These leggings are super soft and really cute. Unfortunately, I had to send them back because it gave me major camel toe.",3,121
It was shipped with a tear/snag that I can’t fix. It’s also a lot bigger  than I thought it would be on me. I’m keeping it because it’s soft and  warm but I wish it didn’t have the flaw and wasn’t so big.,3,204
If you wear glasses it will need to be pushed up to eyes or glass will fog. This is a negative because no pinch bar for the nose area to help stop that from being an issue like a throw away disposable mask would have.,3,217
Neck not flattering.  Color darker than expected.  I returned.  Just not what I thought it was.,3,95
"Nice ring, however, way too big even based on the size chart provided.  Too bad they don't have smaller size available, would have ordered one that fit better.",3,159
"These are very soft and comfortable, however, I will not be wearing them in public. I'm chunky and these cling to every lump and bump on the legs. They are wonderful for eating Cheez-its and watching Law and Order reruns on a Saturday.",3,235
"Not really comfortable, but look good",3,37
"I like the dress, it is pretty and it fits me very good, it is just that the material makes me feel hot during the summer.",3,122
nice pants,3,10
"i love this top.  it appears that it would hide my momma belly.  i ordered my size, medium, and the top was to small at the bottom.  i didn't bother trying on the bottoms so i don't know how they fit. i recommend ordering up.",3,225
THEY OK. HARD AS HELL,3,21
"Fit is true to size and material is soft. They're a little thinner than other Time and True leggings I have. I bought these to wear when I go out but because they're thinner than I wanted I'll be returning. They would be ok for just hanging around the house, or as pajamas.",3,273
It doesn’t look very stylish. Had to buy another belt to make the fit look perfect.,3,83
"OK, but nothing special. I have other faux furs which look much more real. Also, the lengthis a little skimpy. Barely crosses in front.",3,135
We bought 2 of the dragon urn necklace and can't get either one to open so that we can use them.We will mail them back for a full refund unless someone can contact us and help us to solve this problem.The other urns that we purched we are happy with.Thank You,3,259
Wrinkles. Couldn't get through the dinner party without looking like I had rolled around on the floor.,3,102
"If you have a small wrist, it is ok...a little too small for wrapping three times.",3,82
Poor quality.  The tag actually says to hand wash. Who does that?,3,65
For the price i was expecting something a bit bigger.,3,53
"Looks great, it's a little bit of a pain to put on and take off. Also, there isn't much padding so my hands are going numb, usually about an hour in on well paved asphalt on my road bike. My old Pearl Izumi gloves never let me go numb, even after several hours of straight riding",3,279
"It is very hard to find women's XS gloves. The inner liner feels correct, but the outer glove still has 1/2&#34; extra length in the fingers.",3,141
"Small is actually more like a medium. I’m 130 pounds, with a decent sized booty and they’re too big. Also for really loose in the crotch 💁🏼‍♀️ They’re also a much lighter was in person",3,184
"I ordered one size up just in case. Still a bit tight about the bust.<br /><br />Nice material, great length (I'm 5'4&#34;). Just tight in the bust",3,147
"Item was ok, material wasn't really what I expected. But I still wear it",3,72
"These would be so awesome if my ears were pierced properly when I was younger. They are so high that when I try to get cuffs around my lobes they're too tight and not attractive. I think these would look bad-bottomed on a much nicer, less fat ear.",3,247
Ok but they don't last and the charging connection isn't goods,3,62
"These earrings are hard to put on. Once on, they are fine.",3,58
"I wanted to like it because it was cute, but upon opening package I noticed at least 3 to 4 stones were missing and they were not in the package.<br />The four leaf clover itself is cute but appears yellowish is not clear like the picture 🙁",3,240
THEY WERE A LITTLE SMALL.  THEY WORK WELL FOR NOT SKID,3,54
Cute but the strings are pretty long and it looks really fake haha,3,66
These aren't bell bottoms these are boot cut...which was extremely disappointing...but the fit was good just wasn't a bell bottom.,3,130
"Fits way too small, order a 2xx even though i am a 1x. Still does not fit",3,73
like shoe,3,9
Cheao but works,3,15
"I really liked the style & colors of this dress but, the reason why I sent it back was the arm holes were too big otherwise I would have definitely kept it. I really did like the pockets on the dress. Maybe I can try & order a large instead to see if it would fit better.",3,271
"This costume was worth the money. It's not very thick, but full of itchy tule, the dress part like to come up because of the tule. The tights did not fit me. I am 5'6. They stopped at mid thigh. I cut the seem in the toes to get them up all the way and wore shoes.",3,264
"To large, having a hard time trying to find right size.",3,55
not a great dress material is not very nice,3,43
Nice Hoodia but they run extra small. Got a 5X and barely fits. Usually where a 1-2x,3,84
I ordered a size up and it fits well. The string is whiter than the shirt so I didn't wear it. About half of the metal pieces for the holes that the string goes through fell out after it was first washed so now it just looks like the shirt is falling apart with holes in it.,3,274
"And that is a dress made in China that if you dare wash, will immediately fade and disintegrate. Need a one time wear? Yeah totally cute…but these cheap clothes from China are not wardrobe worthy.",3,196
Cap was fine.  I did not realize it was shipping from China when I ordered it.  So it took about 3 weeks to arrive.,3,115
"Run really small, sent them back",3,32
I have washed this twice and each time the lint basket was full. I don't know if this will continue or not but if it does I don't think it will last very long.,3,159
It was just ok.  Material seemed cheap and fit was small.,3,57
I'm thinking this is for a child,3,32
The mother-in-law loved it she said she loves the feel of it.,3,61
One size typically does not fit all. I am on the thinner side but have a wider waist (128 lbs and 30 inch waist). These leggings do not cover my behind and were consistently falling down any time I moved. They do look like the photo and the bottom detail is very cute.,3,268
Hat has a wire rim and felt flimsy.  Returned.,3,46
"Beautiful tie, nice color good Fabric, But come with a lot oil spots",3,68
I bought this for my daughter. She complains that they fall down constantly and the top part of the bear face faded way too soon.,3,129
It's cute and came in on time. I read reviews about how it's made and decided to buy the XXL to be safe but it was too small across my chest area. I'm not sending it back because my daughter can wear it.,3,203
Large was recommended to be but they’re too small to zip :( I was really excited for these,3,90
to me its more of a guys chain. i think they should implement smaller sized chain for women to wear with this as well. but all in all it hasnt turned as of yet so fingers crossed,3,178
Love this item,3,14
Dress fits as expected. The only thing is the split is entirely too high and almost show my underwear. This is not the look I was going for.,3,140
Nice gloves keep my. Hands warman.,3,34
"Runs very wide, but most of these style sandals do run wide.  Pretty shoe, but I have very narrow feet.",3,103
Really like the glasses they sent....however buyer beware glasses in the picture are NOT the glasses sent! They are not aviator style at all!! Luckily I still liked them so I didn't return,3,188
Apparently it’s a wrap romper. The description said belted so naturally I thought that meant it had a separate belt not you have to wrap it and there’s the belt lol. It was too large anyhow,3,189
It runs a little small and it wrinkles very easily,3,50
These don't fit little girls and they are not adjustable.,3,57
I wanted to like these but they were just too small.,3,52
Good bag but I don’t think it’s leather at all.,3,47
I haven’t had it long and the seams are already tearing,3,55
Not durable at all.,3,19
Wrist strap is fine. Crossbody is made to fit a child or small adult. Disappointed.,3,83
What I didn’t like about this product was it seemed it was a Used shirt. It came in the bottom of a plastic bag all bunched up . It was not package like a new shirt.,3,165
"Not a real cycling jersey. My son loves the flash, so the shirt is what he expected. No pockets. It is really a regular shirt.",3,126
"This shirt is ok, very lightweight  and the turtle neck is super flimsy and sloppy looking, not a fan that i can't  wear a bra unless I want my bra straps to show",3,162
"They were great for the costume. I wore a t-shirt, and these kept my arms fairly warm without a jacket. It was pretty cold and rainy for our Halloween this year in SW Ohio, and I was happy with the look and feel of them.",3,220
Nice kids glasses but runs pretty snug for older kids. They are too tight for my 6 year old.,3,92
They don't fit very well but did the trick for Halloween vamp costumes.  Very cheaply made though.,3,98
Compression is just great but they’re sized a bit short in the calf for me (I’m just over 6 ft. (and ordered large. ),3,117
"its ok, order a larger size, i took the advise of other reviewers and ordered a size up and it fits nice, the fabric is not thick.",3,130
"Cute swimsuit, but I wish there was more coverage for my butt. I'm 5'3&#34; 163lbs and wear a size 10/12 and I ordered a large.",3,127
I bought these for myself (i wear a large or size 10/11 in most pants/jeans) they fit my 14 year old daughter who wears a size 2!,3,129
These fit very tightly even on my 1 year old.  Too uncomfortable for my 10 year old to use for very long (who I purchased these for) and she has a smaller head.  They are not adjustable.  Probably good for staying on a baby's head though since they wouldn't be able to remove them easily.,3,288
Not a good product at all. Had gotten 2 Nd both skip while using and stop all together.,3,87
Beautiful Charm.  I could not find a 14K stamp anywhere on it.  My wife is now questioning the authenticity.,3,108
Good but gets rough and cheap after couple of washes and drier makes small balls of lint on it.,3,95
"These run small and narrow. Very pretty otherwise, too bad we had to return.",3,76
Ears itched after one day,3,25
I ordered and recieved 2 pair....one pair was broken,3,52
"Cute and nice fabric. Great value. Larger than expected, they still don’t fit my 6 month old but we will keep them and hopefully in a few months they will work.",3,160
The bars are too big for the 16g hole.  Should be posted as 14g instead.,3,72
Pretty but big! I have small(er) ears and these take up my whole ear.,3,69
"bought to wear for a halloween costume, can you say STATIC CLING?  Wowza!",3,73
cute dress! it’s kinda long but it’s good for when you’re working with kids! I love the dress,3,93
somewhat small for a size large,3,31
Bought this for a Christmas gift exchange for my daughters friend. She loves elephants. She put it on and the rings you hook the clasp to immediately broke.,3,156
Its tight but works. Problem is that the pony's head is cut off.... so that sux,3,79
This is soft and comfy but ran a little bigger than I wanted.,3,61
It's nice but they sent me one that don't work.,3,47
"Everything is excellent, the only thing they to small",3,53
I love the bottoms but the top was way to small 38D ordered XL,3,62
They were smaller than expected,3,31
The band size was right on yet the cup size was way smaller. Love the bra yet would order a size up next time.,3,110
"The buckle is to big to feed through pant belt loops.  Other than that, very cool!",3,82
The actual shirt fit fine but the sleeves are tight. I’ll be returning.,3,71
Cute dress but the ruffles did not look like in the picture. They were small and bunched up. Had to wear a cardigan over it because they looked so weird,3,152
Lots of pretty colors and designs. No replicas. But they break very easily. The top ball cracked on 4 of them already while I wore them.,3,136
"The only issue I had was the print was not well printed. Still like the shirt, but just seem like a poor job done. I have a friend who does screen printing for a living and yes, this was not well printed at all.",3,211
I got this sweater for my granddaughter for Christmas. She absolutely loved it it fit her perfect. But one of the sleeves was not sown together. So we had to have it altered. That is the reason for three stars.,3,210
If you have high arches you are better off with the flip flops,3,62
Works great but the sharp high pitched sound when using it can hurt some people's ears.,3,87
material just OK,3,16
Went by size expected and got a large when I should have got a medium . It's 100% not 71%. Needs to change that.,3,112
"This is a review for the purse, not the shoes lol. I like the purse but it is very stiff and hard to get things in and out. Other than that it’s cute but I definitely wouldn’t pay full price for it!",3,198
My family and I like it very much. Thank you very much.,3,55
I did not read the sizes before I ordered and would definitely have ordered larger size bags.,3,93
Item was returned because I found it somewhat scratchy to exposed skin. I am sensitive to some materials. I did like that it was light weight.,3,142
I’m sure this will be fine for those who are smaller on top. Otherwise you might look pregnant. Seems like a comfy top otherwise. I sent it back. Lots of people will like it though. Soft and relaxed.,3,199
the fabric feels nice.<br />But the overall width is very small/tight compared to others.<br /><br />And that makes the zipper very difficult to zip up,3,151
Ordered 3x fit like large. Don't buy if you have a tummy.,3,57
Not the fit for me,3,18
"Color, fabric, and style are all nice, but it's absolutely gigantic. Order several sizes smaller than you normally would.",3,121
"Fast delivery which was great. But I did notice that the pants stretched out way too much. In the morning, they fit good, but by mid day they were very loose and looked terrible. The shirt was form fitting and pants ended up looking like joggers, loose everywhere and tight int hr ankles.",3,288
Loved the bracelet! So beautiful. However it broke after 5 uses. The end bead fell off in the middle of the day.,3,112
"Tags inside, which I do not like. The inside color does not match the outside which, it is white. Otherwise they are ok",3,119
I feel like this outfit is cut a little wide. But I do like that it’s made of t-shirt material so it will be very comfortable to wear for an extended period of time unlike most special occasion toddler clothing.,3,211
These are Wrangler jeans however they are the thinnest jeans I have purchased ever. Why are all jeans like tissue paper now? The problem with all these thin jeans is they wear/rip out in the stitching in the crotch area from wearing them. After about 10 wears they are worthless.,3,279
"overall 3 stars only because it fits great right out of the box. it’s not too stiff or rough. BUT, it doesn’t fit the apple watch “holes” all that great on the bottom “clasp” or “holes”. it’s very loose, and i am afraid it will eventually break or pop off and cause damage to my watch.",3,285
Rings were too small,3,20
"Great design, but they ran small.  Since they were too small for me, i gave them to my 10 year old niece who is average size and they barely fit here.  I was disappointed",3,170
"Did not fix the snake bracelet,  but they will work maybe on next project. Not today",3,84
They're cool but I thought they'd be blacker and why is there a zipper on the side if there's not a pocket there?,3,113
"its okay, but not great",3,23
These are really cute and the quality seems great. I was okay with paying more for kids glasses if my child got more wear out of them. But I bought the size recommended for my child’s age and they look way too small on her.,3,223
Too thin for modest coverage for women. Double front panel would help!,3,70
Looks a little cheap. But it's ok.,3,34
Skin tight and you can see every detail and curve on my body when I wear this.  So I would not recommend this if you have rolls you want to hide.,3,145
Doesn't look like a ring. Picture is not accurate representation.,3,65
The aren't as pictured,3,22
"The style of the dress is very nice, but the dress is poorly constructed.  The bodice sticks out in the wrong places and gapes under the arms.  If the dress had been constructed better, it would be a beautiful dress.",3,216
It is super cute but the quality is terrible. My daughter had it for 1 week before the stitching started coming undone.,3,119
Got a different kind that I like better and it fits better.,3,59
Has a strong smell in black color,3,33
"They are okay. My pair did not come with the cute fabric belt, and they run super small.  Like 2 sizes too small. However, I do really like them, so I'm using them as my &#34;goal&#34; for the summer.",3,200
It’s a beautiful shirt and I am in love with it. With that being said after washing it it shrunk. Also I only wore it twice and washed it once and it already has a small hole. Really disappointed in the quality of the fabric.,3,225
"Keep in mind that everything but the bottom is lace. This does peak through with many shoes so you really have to adjust it to make it &#34;ultra low-cut&#34; and disappear. Otherwise, they are comfortable and have a lot of texture so they don't slip around too much.",3,267
"Runs small and a lighter weight band around waist would be softer, I have a bad back",3,84
There are good coats but run small and I would’ve liked to keep it if it were offered in a larger size.,3,103
Generous fit. The only complaint I have is the button holes become loose after first wear. They wont stay in the holes. I’ll have to sew them smaller.,3,150
"Cute, but way too big, had to return.",3,37
The shirt has a very boxy feel to it the bottom is completely straight across and for some reason it just doesn't sit right on my body. I wish it fit a little more fitted.  The fabric is also a little stiff.,3,207
Nice watch but it stopped working already.,3,42
The crystal pendant is very beautiful but the necklace itself felt cheaply made but I am satisfied with it just because my boyfriend is satisfied and he really likes it.,3,169
"For the price... what else did I expect.  It's cute for a child, not an adult, unless you use it inside of another bad.",3,119
Perfect pair of inexpensive glasses.,3,36
I loved the organization of this jewelry pouch but when I received it the zipper was broken - I ended up returning it without a replacement.,3,140
"Pretty dress, but runs small especially in the middle tummy area",3,64
"Dress fit good, but the quality is low.",3,39
This dragonfly dangle is so small.,3,34
"I really like this robe, but it is falsely advertised as cotton. The one I got is clearly labeled as rayon. I debated returning it, but I love the mauve pink color and it is large enough to cover my pregnant belly, so I’m keeping it.",3,233
Returned . Was tragic on me<br /><br />My torso was Too short<br /><br />Better for thinner taller girls<br />I am 5’2 & 115,3,124
It's cute and looks exactly like the picture. It's slightly small for me but it looks good and cute! Very nice,3,110
Not a big fan of the fit only kept them because they are extremely comfortable.,3,79
Very small in size,3,18
BROKE EASILY,3,12
Didn't love this.  Everything is too BIG. Not everyone wears bigger than a 4.  Would be nice to have 0/2,3,104
Super cute retro bathing suit! However the bra 'cups' are tiny. I got a bigger size because I have a large chest and the top had zero support or coverage. Perfect for someone who doesn't need it but definitely not appealing for my size Ds.,3,239
"Glasses are crystal clear and he reflective coating appears well done.  They fit over my glasses just fine, but be sure to measure...bad ratings for them not fitting is rediculous.<br />Only two issues. Tint is a little lighter then I would hope and the lenses have a slight bubble look to them.",3,295
"The items arrived quickly, but didn't fit like nor was the natural shape of the dresses.",3,88
Too big-3T was more like a 4T,3,29
"They are exactly what you think they are.  They feel much lighter and cheaper than any I’ve gotten with wallets.  That’s the bad, I’m not sure how well they’d hold up long term.  They’re also slightly textured, which is theory could make it harder to read some text and certain angles.",3,285
"Warning: While you can fit a pair of size 11 man's shoes into these bags, I will let you know, the fit is VERY, VERY tight!  These bags are really only sized for up to men's size 9.  The bags are fairly well made, for the price.",3,228
Pretty but itchy. Wouldn’t buy again.,3,37
Nice skirt for the price but the waist does run small.,3,54
"I love the color, number and size of inside pockets, outside pockets, but it is so stiff.  Not exactly big enough for all my stuff either, but that is my issue.  The stiffness is a deterrent.",3,191
Useful the period of time I needed to use them.,3,47
"Too large for a skinny girl. The quality may not look great, but to the touch feels smooth. Great for chubby or large women.",3,124
"Great, affordable set of plugs!<br />Unfortunately one came broken but overall they're all good quality.<br />It would be great to get the single plug replaced if possible (I don't have the option to request it though, just the option to return them all)",3,254
"Shapeless, unlike the photo where it appears slim fit. Pocket is placed sort of high making it look goofy. I returned it.",3,121
A cheap copy of a Citizen pro master diver. Works alright for now but had to change the band because the one that was on there was just too cheap looking and feeling. I'm pretty sure the watch case is made of plastic.,3,217
too big arnd the armpit area. no inner skort but does have side pockets. back lace is pretty,3,92
I could not wear the hat because it was too narrow for my head.  I end up giving it to my mom for a garden hat.,3,111
"I love the bracelet but it was too big for my wrist. Wish there was a way to tighten it...therefore, I'm giving it a 3 stars.",3,125
A little bigger than I thought and shiny too!,3,45
The color is a little deceiving. It's a little lighter and less tan than the picture.,3,85
Nice design but the metal has started to fade and become dull. Didn't last 6 months.,3,84
Low quality. Get what you pay for. Otherwise it’s beautiful,3,59
"They were ok, you get what you pay for if its cheap they will work cheap but its a temporary toy but it was ok",3,110
Order a size or two bigger. I’m 5’7 160 and ordered a large. It’s just a little to tight and short in the arms.,3,111
Feather is missing,3,18
"I absolutely love the look of the watch, but the clasp is horrible.  It takes some effort to shut it and I'm scared every time I try to open it that I'm going to break a nail.",3,175
Waist was way smaller that the measurements outlined in the sizing table. I hope the return goes smoothly because the shorts are exactly what I was looking for other than that!,3,176
Super cute but it doesn’t fit your entire glasses in it.  About a good inch and a half sticks out so it won’t protect them.  It’s basically a stuffed animal you can partially put your glasses in.,3,195
coarse material is a bit uncomfortable on the skin.,3,51
Band fell off first time I wore it. Glued back on.,3,50
"Not sure why they're called ""compression.""  I bought to wear under dresses/blouses that show my bra straps. I kept them for that reason alone. A tad disappointing though.  I would not recommend.",3,194
"It does what its says,  but for me it's too bulky to carry in pocket.",3,69
Should have a long back as well as a long front. Just like the movie,3,68
Product came with parts missing and the customer service is horrendous,3,70
"This bathing suit  fits just as expected. I like it all much, I took it on vacation. Received many compliments.",3,111
It’s ok. Fit a little big but also lost elasticity very quickly.,3,64
"These shoes are precious.  However, my daughter has such a small and narrow foot that they were a little too wide for her.  I ended up returning them.",3,150
soft and looks just like the photo however is a bit flimsy. i pulled the strap in order to tighten the knots and the stitches broke. no biggy since its just the strap and cant complain w this price point. need somw major heels to wear this,3,239
"All worked, but not for very long. When they worked they were great. Wish they would have lasted more than an hour or two.",3,122
"You need to have a lot of hair, plus a high pony tail for this hat. The back of hat is literally not there!  It is like a visor style in the back,",3,146
The quality was beautiful and was an amazing coat just way too small,3,68
"This is a really nice top, i love the design and the color. My only problem was that it was basically a small T-shirt rather than a crop to to me, as some of the parts fit quite loosely. And if i bought a smaller size it wouldn't have fit.",3,239
The top doesn't fall off my shoulder,3,36
Items are small,3,15
It’s fine. A little small in my oppion. Material feels worn. I would have returned if I didn’t miss the window...,3,113
Bottom is quite small and top is large.,3,39
"The dress itself is nice: decent material, good cut/fit and nice color. However, even after 3 washes, it has a smell. It's odd because I cannot say exactly what it smells like, but it isn't pleasant.",3,199
"They are cool but when one of them fell, the little face plate came out …",3,73
"Bello producto, pero muy grande! Conviene comprarlo un talle menos del que se cree.",3,83
The outside of the bag looks great but the inside feels like a cheap  nylon. for 20 dollars its okay.,3,101
Thin material and smelled of chemicals when I ironed on a HTV vinyl monigram.  I bought other canvas bags in pack of 12 that were much better quality and cheaper per unit.  They do the trick and have held up so far but in comparison they could be better quality.,3,262
A little shorter than I expected,3,32
A little small but I am satisfied with it. Very pretty.,3,55
"My wife really enjoys them, they fit well",3,41
"The photo on the left is after one wash, the right is a brand new pair. Like the material but shrinks.",3,102
Please keep in mind this runs very small. At least I was able to use the necklace that came with it. I think these shirts are Asian size or something.,3,150
Had to glue one of them. It came apart.,3,39
Nice lenses and fit perfectly. 3 only because Doesn't have the word &#34;polarized&#34; on the lens as shown in the picture. Comes in a nice soft case. I would absolutely recommend for replacement lenses in the future.,3,218
Shoes look exactly like picture however Right shoe Does not fit well because the the straps of the right shoe is longer than the left shoe.,3,139
"It's a very pretty chain, but it bends a little, and doesn't really have a shine to it, no weight to it really. But it's definitely worth what I paid for it.",3,157
"They are ok, not what i expected.",3,33
"Came with two small holes in them, but otherwise very good looking gloves",3,73
"Foot Zen Socks fit well and are comfortable even though they are quite thin.  All my other white socks come out white in the wast, but these socks look grey after washing.",3,171
This is not actually INC. Its an off brand.,3,43
too see through for me,3,22
Plenty of length in the skirt but unless you have a backside it will fit poorly in that area.,3,93
The space for the second toe is too short.,3,42
The material feels and sounds a little weird but it fits me well and it's cute!,3,79
The underwear is nice however they sent one pack without the bottoms.  Beware.,3,78
Dislike.  Wasn't what ir appeared,3,33
This product is thin and appears to be made by cheap materials. Bc it’s light weight it may get more use... but I’m concerned about the size. I would’ve returned it for a smaller version but they don’t have any in stock. Does not shrink when washed.,3,249
These were much smaller than anticipated.  Bought to add to a charm bracelet but couldn't  because of the poor quality. I'll figure out a use for them at a later date.,3,167
These are incredibly hard to put on a toddlers feet. after wearing them in the water they smell terrible.  pretty cute though.,3,126
Fabric is a bit flimsy. And I would’ve preferred it to be a thong back.,3,71
"This is a light weight robe, but the fabric is not very nice. It’s best feature is the snap front.",3,98
"Unflattering, straps too short, not comfortable material.",3,57
a lot of variety but I wont use 99% of these.,3,45
The watch is very pleasing in appearance but much to difficult to distinguish the time at a glance. Watch was returned.,3,119
"its an OK product, but not recommended for places where the sunshine is strong, such as Tel Aviv",3,96
"not for a 40"" + waist.  not long enough.",3,40
"You get what you pay for. It looks nice enough, but the nylon is cheap and flimsy and the buckle isn't well constructed. The watch keeps falling off.",3,149
It did not seems to keep me as cool as I had hoped. I could have wet a towel and put it around my neck and gotten the same results.,3,131
"The dress has an attractive shape, even though the picture indicates that it is much fuller in the skirt than it really is. I would prefer the material to be more movable. The main complaint that I have about dresses such as these are the waists are way too high.",3,263
"I like that it holds a lot of my products, but when you hang it, they tend to spill out of the front.  Wish there were a little more support to hold the items in the bag while it's hanging.",3,189
He says they are good,3,21
works fine just hasn't softened up much which after 3-4 weeks I figured it would.  Seems strong and durable.,3,108
"Was Christmas very cute, but longer then normal beanie style hats, and very snug. Just makes someone with short hair look bald almost. But soft and cute.",3,153
Tight.  More like a small large.,3,32
"The automatic functions are ok,  I bought a second one with a steel strap.  It works.  It’s two minutes fast every two days. But it works.",3,138
Was smaller than expected.,3,26
"Bought these for the hubby and they fit great,  and look great. The black came a bit bluer than expected and I guess o didn't read the product details closely enough but they actually look more like jeans. Also, make sure you get a lint roller because they pick up lint like crazy?!!",3,283
One of my earrings didn't have the slide in connector and the others hole in the earring was too low and I my ear lobe was squished. I love these kinds of earrings and was sadly disappointed. :(,3,194
I wasn't thrilled with the consistency or the glide.,3,52
The bathing suit was just very big. The bottoms looks like a large diaper. I would recommend getting one size smaller. I had to return the bathing suit because it was just too large.,3,182
"I like these but the posts are way to long and they stab the back of your ear when you lay down,.. so cute but not real comfy honestly. Do not recommend napping with them in.",3,174
would be better with a different clasp,3,38
It is very thin and cheap,3,25
"The stone is red when held up to light from the back but looks brown when on the finger.  Apart from this, the setting and the cabochon are nice enough for the price for male or female.  Doesn't really look as important as the picture.",3,235
Inexpensive but cheap,3,21
They are cute for the price....however run big.,3,47
How’s the California danger material tag. Was returned.,3,55
Hat is decent. Not the color I hoped it would be.,3,49
"The leather  of this boot is very soft and made of good quality; however, the design of the boot is too short for US size standards.  I bought three pairs and had to return all of them.",3,185
Nice T-shirt but the part the sequin have been sawn on the shirt is showing on the outline of the superman sequin. The white part should have been hided inside the shirt.,3,170
I bought this for my dad and it barely covers his ears. I looked at review photos and they seemed to fit other men well. I am not sure why ours seemed so small. I tried it on (small female) and it was tight to my head as well.,3,226
The glasses are cool and the tint is good but the crome is very reflective and usually shines the sun into your eyes. They do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. But they look cool,3,196
"I ordered a size larger than I normally wear<br />Thinking it would fit comfortably. No such luck, fits snug around the arms.  Had to Loosen it around the arm area. Ok for  costume use.",3,185
Exacty as described.,3,20
The fabric is a little thin,3,27
nothing to say,3,14
Too large for 2 month old and ribbons bend and looks funny on infant. May look better on older child.,3,101
"It's just okay. Good quality fabric and coloring. It definitely shows off the booty and is not appropriate for &#34;boating with dad&#34;.<br />It does absolutely nothing for your boobs. No underwire, lightly lined, and no push up at all. If you have fake boobs this swimsuit would look great.",3,293
Way too large. Ordered 0-3 and 18-24 and they were more like 6-9 and 4T.,3,72
Size was too small 3x,3,21
Outfit was nice but does not come with panty.,3,45
"It is a very beautiful watch. However, mine arrived with a dead battery. The sticker on the case lid says ""battery change March 2021."" Maybe the problem is not just a battery? Return.",3,183
I like the shirt but is not long like in the photo. It is a short fit. Does not cover my bottom with leggings on. Also has threads coming out on the sleeve.,3,156
"Not quite as pictured. I thought it would be a leopard print with mostly browns, but it was more of a muddled black. Looked to be quality material, but just did not meet my expectations.",3,186
wish it was bigger,3,18
I would like a full refund please. I will reach out to the seller. This is not a good buy. Fabric crushes as well.,3,114
I thought I was getting 2 pairs.  Picture is deceiving. Sunglasses are great though and have a flexible width and are super comfortable.,3,136
"The design is fantastic... I got it for my wife for Mother's Day. Unfortunately it didn't last 3 weeks, and was used seldom. The stitching was poor and fell apart. Get what you pay for? I don't know.",3,199
The material is thinner and the sleeves shorter.  The sleeves stop above my elbows.  As pictured I thought they would go past them.,3,131
The dress is beautiful but it is very long. I am 5&#34;4.,3,57
"I felt it was a little to eh, pinkish and the quality in the stitching and fabric selection just wasn't there.",3,110
The style and color are very attractive but I'm not crazy about the material.,3,77
"Just as I expected, however very tight between the toes.",3,56
Just ok.  Good for hanging out on vacation but not dressy,3,57
"I only use it once for wild rides, and it’s does hold my Cochlear implants real good.",3,85
These lenses come well packaged and they fit the frames just right. So what's not great about them? The optics are poor. Everything looks out of focus. With prescription lenses in they are worse because you are trying to read something and it is difficult. Too bad. They look good too.,3,285
It has great look - texture & compliments my watch. However the strap is very long.<br /><br />Strap measures normally from buckle to watch ... but the length of 'tail' is over 1.5' longer then other watch bands - making the appearance ill fitted.,3,247
"I very lightly used this (super cute) purse for less than a year and the strap broke at one end, with no way to sew it back on. :( I'll use the bag itself as a travel container for toiletries or something, but I'm sad it didn't last as long as I would have hoped.",3,263
"The jeans were too low in the front , I sent them back. Normally GV jeans fit very well these do not.",3,101
"I like the straw hole, but it doesn’t fit around my face as snug as other masks.",3,80
"Loved the pattern but this cardigan was too big, it went to my knees. I am 5 ft....",3,83
"They're okay. They are too tight when you first put them on, it's suffocating. But then when they're stretched out, they end up falling off my face.",3,148
A little too tight on their thigh.,3,34
"I really liked the style and color of this dress; however, I had to return due to small sizing.",3,95
Not too bad. A little small,3,27
Very cute but is very small. Looks more like a jr size fit then woman's.,3,72
they look very nice but I'm allergic to nickel and I had to take them off right after putting them in my ears. I returned them immediately.,3,139
Did not look like the picture the bottom half was darkere the fit,3,65
Thinner fabric.  Runs small,3,27
"Not Ropalia.  Cute sports bra, I wear it a lot... but not the same as a Ropalia",3,79
Kinda cheaply made but my daughter loved it,3,43
"It's a good bag with lots of room and pockets. The only thing is it's not very structured, with all the things I carry it makes the bag very slouchy looking",3,156
"Very comfortable but not exactly what I imagined...hoped for a slight tapering into the knee are as pictured - for a more classic, sophisticated look. These are not tapered at all and seem a bit boxy as a result. These seem more matronly.",3,238
"Meh, I wanted it to feel more like metal, but it's very plastic-feeling. Overall it looks pretty nice, though.",3,110
The purse did not look like the picture ! It looks very cheap!,3,62
Fits at least a size too small,3,30
would be nice if arrived as a gift with a working battery!!!!!,3,62
It runs a little small and there are loose threads. Also the tulle is more blue than black but overall not bad for $6,3,117
Starting flaking within 4 days,3,30
I got them then I no longer need compression stocking of that type,3,66
Cute! The quality could be better.,3,34
"While I really like this bathing suit I feel it runs a tad small. Also when I received it, it only came with the top. Very disappointed. I returned with no issues.",3,163
"Sized for larger wrists.  If you have a small to medium wrist, prepare for an annoying dongle.",3,94
Very thin cover worked well for about 2 weeks then got holes in it disappointed in the overall value,3,100
I would rather have luggage tags that are enclosed in some sort of pouch to better protect the information on the tag.  I did permanent marker but it kind of blurred somewhat.,3,175
Too tight on crotch area,3,24
cheap price but stones were very dull and easily fell off,3,57
"This runs smaller than the size guide indicates, by at least one size, maybe two.  The material is also very thin, like felt.",3,125
Had to send this back because of the fit.  But really loved the material.,3,73
"These are small, so if you have a big head, you might find them too tight. Otherwise they are fine.",3,99
Runs small. I would prefer a size bigger.,3,41
"I think they'd be great but after trying to break them in for a day, left foot went number, too small, order half size larger.",3,126
Love the look and feel but it’s very long.  Hard to tuck and look right.  I am short so I’m sure that’s part of it.,3,115
"Well constructed, but far too small.  Even if I leave my long hair outside the hat (what's the point?) it is still too small to wear comfortably all day.  Gave it away to a child.",3,179
When we got it it says YL on the package witch is youth large and it does not say that in the discription. Other than that it is nice,3,133
Appears to be good product but sizing was wrong and have not been able to use.,3,78
Was big around the shoulders,3,28
Very small. Would only reccomend for people 5'5 & under and only size 8 or below. Arm sleeves are very thin too.,3,112
"Pro:It is cheap, and simple to install.  But that is true for most of NATO straps.<br /><br />Cons: it’s rather stiff and not comfortable.  I wish I just bought a more expensive one .",3,183
"Ran a little small. My daughter 4'11"", about 125 lbs, tried size 6, had to buy size 8, still tiny tight. I had to take up length, true for any slacks i buy her. Fabric typical, stiff work polyester. Theyre ok, as far as food service industry goes.",3,247
Items are nice. Just did not receive the hair ties! Not a huge problem but do not like expecting something and not getting it.,3,126
"Havent tried them on yet as they are a gift, but they looked small. 3 stars as I haven't confirmed the sizing yet.",3,114
Wears large for a small size and I weigh 128lbs. but good material and I still wore to work,3,91
"This is ok, I don’t expect a lot of durability from it. This is made from the same fabric that a small child’s backpack is made from...the nylon made to feel like canvas stuff. It’s also not as big as I thought it would be but it still holds a lot.",3,248
My wife loves it but the plastic piece at end broke off so it hard to keep charms in place,3,90
The purse is nice enough but it is definitely a dark red wine color.  Even the tag on it reads wine.  I ordered a nice bright red but that's not what I got.  Quite disappointed.,3,177
The neckline is a little higher than shown in the picture.,3,58
Needed to return due to the length.,3,35
"I am 38B and they are kind of tight, also they are not the same, some of the are smaller.",3,89
"I like the shoe, but my 9 year old's 1.5 sized foot doesn't fit with these shoes. We like the style, we just need to get a larger size.",3,135
My sisters broke after just a few days of use. Mine is fine. She's going to try and fix it. It was the only keychain on her ring. She put it on after she got her new truck. So disappointed that that happened. I really hope she can fix it!,3,238
this is cute--however this is a just fit for me. i am normally an xl  --in general will go up a size in non american clothing since i have large boobs to make sure the item will fit.  this is a touch tight around the chest and arm area,3,235
The flare is too much for my ears.,3,34
Had to return it because it was way too big for my arm but it was a nice item.,3,78
The sleeves were a little too short for me and I'm not a big person 5' 2&#34; 130 lbs.,3,86
I kept this item but I later sold it in a garage sale.  I didn't care for the look of this.  It looked a bit cheap in regards to the leather.,3,141
"I am using these bags for masks.  5 bags were good, 4 not so good but we're still usable and one I tossed.",3,106
cute purse and looks just like the picture but the straps broke easily.,3,71
This skirt is cute but the material is more of a satin plastic type of material and I did not like that. Beware that when purchasing this item it’s cut small. I usually wear a med I got a large and it’s still tight so choose wisely,3,231
I brought this for my daughter it does not come with the white drawstrings. They was rainbow. Will never buy from this shop again.,3,130
"These are really pretty earrings! However, the clip-on part bends and is easily disformed. Would we good for a one time event (like prom.)",3,138
I ordered the pink dress. What I received was a red dress that has a few pink highlights. Not quite what I wanted. It does fit and is a fun dress. But I was really wanting the pink that I thought I bought.,3,205
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL  BUT! THE RING WAS NOT A SIZE 8 AND THE EARRING BACKS DO NOT FIT ON THE POST! IF NOT FOR THESE 2 FLAWS  I WOULD DEFINITELY GAVE A 5 STAR REVIEW..,3,164
"Way to tight, not happy",3,23
"This rubs a little big, I also think the material is thinner than all her other swimsuits. The print is fine and I really like the style of the swimsuit. I don't think it'll make it for an entire summer, it reminds me of those cheap suits that discolor.",3,253
I like the colors.  I can never get the right size. Every brand seems to be different in my size. One of my shirts came inside wrapped in a plastic bag. The other two were not. It made me wonder if they returns.,3,211
The band snaps are of poor quality and will easily unhook if you bump it. The shipping was faster than except though.,3,117
Too wide for face,3,17
The only complaint I have was how big they are. Was expecting them to be a bit smaller... quality is nice,3,105
"No instructions with the earrings, if your ear lobes are small you have to mash the steel posts down tight to stay in the crawler position.",3,139
Casual le quedo muy bien,3,24
It was beautiful but too heavy as a necklace,3,44
Will help with the glare. However was hoping for a better removal of glare.,3,75
um a little thin but works,3,26
Cute pants. Super high waisted and comfy. I do wish they didn't stretch out so much after I wear them. I bought the smallest size available but would go smaller if possible.,3,173
They run easily,3,15
It doesn’t fit well,3,19
"This corset define try fit too small! The corset itself looks and feels cheaply made, I guess you get what you pay for. Will never buy again.",3,141
"Unless you are 5' or shorter, this is not a dress in any way. I am very tall (6'1&#34;) but I have a very short torso. This barely covers my butt. The quality is good and it looks nice but it is not nearly as long as I expected.",3,228
This was my first time wearing shape wear and I didn't like it. It doesn't hold well and the thing part cut me in the back. I'm not a huge woman but I am bottom heavy.,3,167
"Very good quality for price, but thought this color was more of a purple when its really very brown.",3,100
Super cute. I'm am 8 1/2 and the shoe around my ankle is really big. I may have to try relacing them.,3,101
"I like this dress, it has lots of stretch and is thick enough where it doesn't show everything. I don't know how much it will last though, the colours got a little dull after the first wash.",3,190
"The belt is okay, but is shorter than advertised.  Order one size larger for good fit.  Price has doubled since I made a purchase,  it is not worth the doubled price but is worth what I paid for it.",3,198
wrong item received but the seller refunded me so i'm okay with the service... also i like these frames because i thought that the arms popped off and on easily.. these are knock offs so theyre screwed on /:,3,207
Shorter then what I expected and they are see through. Runs a size to small,3,75
Its Comey. My daughter wears it for dance class,3,47
Much smaller visor than expected. Should return. Useless in sun,3,63
"The stone  is beautiful and far exceeded my expectations.  The chain is also pretty,  butbit is very poorly made.  We have three of these neclaces and teo of the chains have already broken within less than two months of occasional use.  I'd  say,  put it on another chain!",3,272
"This product felt nice, but runs about 2 sizes too small!",3,57
"This bra definitely gave me a better shape!  Boobs up and in. However, like other posts, size was too small. I’m going to order two sizes up and see if that works.",3,163
Sparkles come off very easily. Daughter still loves the shoes though.,3,69
The only thing is I wished the heart was a little bet smaller,3,61
So disappointed washed it and neck tie on one side came off .,3,61
Can’t wear these! Still just sitting in my closet floor cause they’re way too small. I ordered my normal size.,3,110
Not for women with big breasts.,3,31
Too large! I have to return,3,27
Got them for my large 3mo baby. Foot was good size but the top part/band was not as stretchy for his chubby ankles,3,114
Not very moisture wicking so not very flattering for working out unless you are ok with sweat stains and people staring,3,119
Looks great on people didn’t love the fabric . Maybe needs good pressing I returned it,3,86
"It’s an ok top. I ordered a medium and it’s still way too big, but if you’re looking for an overly large top then this would be perfect. Not particularly my favorite.",3,166
"These look awesome in and add a fun element to any outfit, but these are not real ear weights. They are surprisingly light and some of my stone plugs are heavier then these.",3,173
Not sold on it yet- has a &#34;odor&#34; so hopefully in time it will go away- I love the color so for the price it works.,3,122
"This dress is not made for tall people. Very cute and great fit overall, but I won't be able to sit down. I'm 6 ft tall and all sizes had the same length. Unsure if I want to pair it will leggings yet or just not sit.",3,217
These are nice boots but expect a suede boot with shiny toe tops? Weird. Is that the hipster style now?,3,103
"Buy at least 1 size up.  It is not true to size.  I like the hoodie, just had to give it to someone else.",3,105
Nice quality and very cute shorts but too small.,3,48
They are pretty but It says 925 sterling silver on site but when arrived it only had a little charm that says d 925 not stamped anywhere on the piece I’m not sure it if is real silver or not,3,190
"Very cute! It is smaller than I thought it would be, almost as if its for a child. For it being smaller than a typical headband, it is flexible enough to wear on an adult head and doesn't feel tight.",3,199
"They are nice and all but they were a little too heavy, I took off like 6 of the tiny hoops now they don’t weigh down as much.",3,126
"Got them for my son to use on the deck of the gym pool, and they work for that. However, if he wears them too long,  he says they hurt the back of his ankle.<br /><br />The plastic clips connecting the ends of the elastic laces fell off of both shoes after the third wearing.",3,275
Its big on me .. material is poor quality,3,41
"Comfortable, well made & good color. Could be a little longer. I'm 5'10&#34; hits approx 3-4 inches below belt line.",3,116
Looks nice and all but an xl fit me small had to give to my son,3,63
"Great material, but if anyone orders these they should order one size larger than they normally would. Mine ended up being one size too small even though the tag says it ought to be my size.",3,190
"They're pretty shirts but they lay weird once they're on and the material is very thin. Definitely a shirt, not a sweater. Not to mention it's a little short, but the rest of the shirt fits fine",3,194
Very weird cut.,3,15
I can’t post video cause I returned them because I ordered wrong one’s for my daughter,3,86
This is made out of the cheapy clothes you buy from the ads on Facebook kind of material. My son can’t stand it,3,111
Mine came with a broken strap but it still works for what I need it for. So overall i'll give a 3.,3,98
Very light weight. Nice design. Very comfortable but the sole started peeling off after a couple weeks of light use.,3,116
Nice fit not as warm as I expected,3,34
The product is satisfactory my issue is it was a week and a half late and took over a month to get here make sure to check your measurements for they're size chart as it will be small if you get your normal size other than that it's very cute and I love it💜,3,257
Has no stretch whatsoever. Does not fit over my boobs and i usually wear a medium in tops. That is the size i got so i was surprised when it was too small for my chest. :( Cute top for smaller boobs i guess. Hopefully I can adjust it because i would like to wear it.,3,266
A little bit small but still love them,3,38
I love this bathing suit I wish the top had a little more material to it for a double D woman,3,93
The medium too is more like a small,3,35
"It's okay, I thought it would look more like rose gold verses rusty gold.",3,73
The sleeve was torn (See pictures) the seller was ok did refund me but the fit was ok wouldn’t buy again a little loose in chest area.,3,134
The top fit true to the size. But the bottoms are wayyy too large.,3,66
pretty but very difficult to manage the glass beads on the ends,3,63
Very pretty but one pair immediately snapped.  Kind of cheaply made,3,67
"i am normally a large in shirts, occasionally a medium. i read other reviewers that fit this profile suggesting a size small for compression. the small was great, the medium would have looked like a normal tank, the large would have hung off of me.",3,248
"I'm 5'2, 105lbs. I bought the medium because I like my clothes loose fitting. My only complaint with this shirt is that it's sooo long. It comes to my mid thigh. The material isn't as soft as I'd like, but at least it's not crunchy. I won't purchase this shirt again.",3,267
string broke after two weeks of wear.  ended up attaching the mittens with clips instead.,3,89
I'm gonna give this a try. After I have tried it for 30 days I'll come back to update my review.,3,96
Not ce,3,6
"I felt it was true to size, but it was right on me. So I gave it to my sister and she says it runs small. So it’s like a small/medium. Size up one.",3,147
I was disappointed at the fit and feel of these socks.,3,54
I thought the bead size was larger. 8 inches is big for a small wrist. May be returning it.,3,91
Not quality made and somewhat small.,3,36
A bit too much fabric. Less is good sometimes.,3,46
not as it appears on pictures,3,29
I can't raise my arms without my ass showing,3,44
"I bought this as a gift for my little in my sorority. I thought it is cute but the ord it comes with is very cheap, you'll probably want to replace it with an actual chain. It's just as pictured so what you see is what you get. I was just hoping for slightly better quality.",3,274
Fits small and came with a rip in seam. Bummer,3,46
I like the bag I just thought it would be bigger.,3,49
"I loved the look, but the chain broke a week after receiving it.",3,64
It's ok. My husband didn't really care for it.,3,46
I need a adjustment on the watch band it's large enough for a giant for almost two wrist.  Can you guys help correct this?,3,122
Darker color than what was pictured.  Very dark blue. Still pretty,3,66
"Ok I like the design. But the cons, then band is way to long for me. And one side pops off with the lightest bump. I went back to other band sincr it stays on way better.",3,170
"The shirt, glasses and necklace fits well. The wig sheds and the pants have a hole in the private area. To close to Halloween party time to try and get another one.",3,164
"Ok so the chain broke the first time I wore it, which was on the way to LAX at 4am.  Not a great way to start a trip, but I rigged up a fix on the fly (see what I did there -- I'm charming) and I get compliments every time I wear it!  Looks 👍 but lining is kinda lame.",3,268
Ehhh they’re okay - but very tight and do not stay up well.,3,59
"Worked well for months, then it stretched out and the tracker fell out.",3,71
great idea but it was hard if not impossible to remove the transparent strips from the adhering paper.  Would really love to hear<br />that this problem was resolved.,3,166
"Does not look or fit anything as in the picture, it's a bit big.",3,64
"The shape of the collar is a little awkward & the material is a thicker stitching stye and a tad scratchier than what I would have liked. I may be returning this one, it's just an okay shirt, nothing more than what I would expect to get out of a Ross.",3,251
For a extra large the sleeves were about four inches short.,3,59
"I tried these glasses and had to do a double take when I looked at myself in the mirror.  The lens has little curvature, making these glasses look like novelty fashion.  I liked the lens color but decided to return the glasses as I couldn't shake a sense of the over-the-top novelty look and feel.",3,297
The pants fit perfect! Although the Jacket fit her 6 year old sister. I ask for a 14 woman's and got a Large one size fits all. It actually said in the collar L.,3,161
Product is nice.  Good fit.  Just not nearly as thick as it looks in the picture.,3,81
Item is cute but way too large maybe by a whole size - had to return both because they did not offer smaller sizes,3,114
A big snug for my taste!,3,24
"A bit larger than expected, lucky we won't need it for another 2-3 months so my duaghter should grow into it<br />material is nice, isn't really a bathing suit",3,159
Lil small fkr my 11yr old. But he likes it!,3,43
"IT'S OK, SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE ZIPPER PLACE FOR KEY WITH OUT HAVING TO USE THAT INSIDE THING.",3,92
"Craftsmanship is very good, fits my large face well, but it does not cut down glare at all.",3,91
"feathers everywhere!  This was for a costume party so it was ok, but the rate in which they shed they won't last many uses.",3,123
The elephant trunk is not a trunk. It looks like a rhino. The headband is ok. This is def meant for a toddler or a small child.,3,127
I bought this as a gift for my daughter in law. It's nice for the price but arrived with the chain broken. I was able to repair it  with some small needle nose pliers.,3,167
I really like it but the sizes are off. I ordered a large cause it like my skirts loose. It was very small.,3,107
Ordered size 6-7 but it’s got for 5 yr old! Size up plz,3,55
The dress is beautiful but it runs small. If you have big hips/thighs consider sizing up. I ordered a large and it is too small around that area.,3,145
"Purchased this for my son, he loves it. I was not happy with the look of the fabric, its like a basketball jersey material. The material that snags and stains easily.",3,166
Loved the top but the description fails to inform the purchaser that it is flared at the bottom.,3,96
Its usable product.,3,19
"My only complaint about these were the back fell off of the earrings a lot, i even lost the earring because of that few times. Good prduct though",3,145
Gems fell out quickly,3,21
"Picture looks like thin  flowing fabric but it's not.  It's more like a thick t-shirt. Will be a sweater I wear at home, only.",3,126
"Great shoe and comfy but only after a few days of wear, the shoe began to peel away from the back heel.",3,103
cute bracelet but it has a strange odor??? hope the odor goes away!,3,67
Hat was restrictive without adjusting to size. Material was bery stiff.,3,71
Everything was great except it's see through sheer. Have to wear under clothes. More like laungerie than dress to wear out somewhere.,3,133
"I bought this because I thought it was cotton.  When it arrived, I tried it on and the fit is fine, but the material feels a lot more like rayon than cotton - maybe I'm wrong, but there was no tag inside the skirt that gave material contents so I sent it back.",3,260
These are ok but very very loose. Was hoping for better quality of the material. I just don't feel these will hold up to multiple uses as they will stretch out very easily and not spring back.,3,192
"My daughter really liked them, but after about 30 minutes of wearing them, she would complain they were hurting her ear lobes and we would take them off. Inevitably, one side was always coming off. Cute idea, but we decided to just pierce her ears.",3,248
Fit small.,3,10
"This top is thin but comfy .. the back hem is long and the back pockets sag with any amount of weight in them .  My husband riding behind me said it looked ""funny""  I liked the coolness of the material .. I will wear for short rides only",3,237
Nice fabric but is snug through the bust and a little short.  Maybe a large would be better. Normally wear an 8 is dress size.,3,126
"Well made tapers for stretching, however, they are listed as 25mm when they are, in fact, 24mm. Not 1 inch(25mm).",3,113
This dress didn't work for me.  I think maybe in a different color or size it might be better but the material looked a little bit cheap.,3,137
"The chains where a bit longer ad thicker then I expected, but till what I wanted overall",3,88
Tried it on and it was snug on my hips. I dislike the fabric but enjoy style.,3,77
"These are decent tank tops, a little on the thinner side. Overall happy with the tanks but I think they should be priced much lower. Not worth $30 in my opinion, should be more around $20 if that.",3,196
"It feels nice, the stretch material allows it to be comfortable on the waist, but it is flared on the bottom making it seem as it was  meant for a short person. Now I have to have it professionally tapered.  The color runs too.",3,227
"I was dissapointed at first, there were some inperfections but to be expected with the price given. Once I tried it on my 7 month old, fell in love! It looked so cute on her! Runs a tad small these is perfect for babies, not bigger kids.",3,237
Doesn't fit as expected.,3,24
"It's taking me forever to try to bend them to fit my bottom teeth, they're to big",3,81
Not quite what I expected but they fit and work for me.,3,55
I loved the shoes and I’m able to fit in 6.5 youth but for some reason they were too small.<br />I would like to buy the size bigger but not understanding why I paid $59 for the 6.5’s but they want $100 for a size up.. makes no sense,3,233
The keychain has a nice sentiment.  The case it was put in was a bit cheap and broke easily.  I ordered a few of them and one was a bit scratched but could still be used.  Overall okay.,3,185
So far so good and pins haven't fallen off or straps breaking yet but is cheaply made.  But runs good so far.,3,109
The color was good and they fit well until they were washed.<br />Next time I would order a larger size.,3,104
These are cute but they are HUGE. You can untie and adjust size but I couldn’t get the bow to look good again. I personally didn’t like that you have to readjust the size. Not small enough for infant. Maybe a toddler,3,216
Definitely thought it would be more of an emerald green....,3,59
It was disappointing to see them wear out so fast… they weren’t cheap!!,3,71
"She thinks it's too low in the front.  Not sure, shell wear it.  May have to exchange for different size.  Pretty top.",3,118
Runs small and definitely can't return to China.,3,48
Really pretty but for the price the seams shouldn't unravel after a couple days.,3,80
The cut was nice but the fit was a little off.  Fabric did not breathe well and looks a little faded though.  I returned.,3,121
Nice mask but the fit is uncomfortable.,3,39
"The face covering is very lightweight and comfortable to wear. It’s completely inappropriate for virus protection, as it is very thin. However, for increased warmth in outdoor activities, I would wear it.",3,204
"Not a huge fan of the material. It feels pretty cheap. The pattern is cute and the fit isn’t bad, but I’m returning because of the material.",3,140
Love the colors and weight of this hoodie.  My only complaint is the neck opening is  tight and shoulders seem large.,3,117
"Honestly, these are some of the most comfortable work shoes I have ever owned. With that being said...if you work in a shop, these shoes aren't for you. Especially if you're doing real fabrication or construction. They didn't even last me 6 months. Holes and failures everywhere on both shoes.",3,293
Got 2 out of 3 package but it said 3 were sent in 1 package.  Let's see how this will be handled,3,96
Reasonable in terms of quality and similarity to pic,3,52
This dress is something I would not wear in public it is more like a nightgown and shorter than I had anticipated,3,113
"Body of dress fits nicely but top too lose. I’m 5’0 and 105 lbs, and couldn’t keep the top up with a size small.",3,112
"Beautiful Boot, but not True to B(M) sizing. I have 2 of the exact same boot and brand with just different designs. Very narrow width. If you fit true to B(M), these will be too narrow. I'm having to return, and now wait longer to wear them :(",3,243
3 and a half... Just have to get use to it.,3,43
Present disjointed area,3,23
"I’m 5’4” and 160 lbs. These are cute but definitely not high wasted. The material is a little thin. Arguably, these barely fit me.",3,130
"Compression socks are very hard to put on, but they fit ok, wash nicely.  The polka dots are not printed on, they are woven onto the sock.  They leave little polka dot dents in my legs.",3,185
The magnets were not very strong and fell off very easily,3,57
The product is too big and it goes below the knee,3,49
It was perfect when I first tried it. But after washing it shrunk 25%.,3,70
I’m 5’4 130 pounds 34b. I’m thicker below than up top. The small was really tight so I am returning the small to order a medium instead. The one in the pic is a small. Love the colors. Hoping the medium will be just right. Both the bottoms and top were too tight.,3,263
It actually looks nice but the ribbons were too short to wrap around my head and the eye holes were small and kept poking me in the eyes. i will be returning these.,3,164
Love this! Perfect fit however it is much shorter in the front than I expected.,3,79
The words are only printed on one side and wasn't as easy to read.  It is cute for the price and a costume jewelry.,3,115
"Product is good quality for the price. However, the photo does not match the actual band I received",3,99
It looks like a decent band but not sure how long it will last. Leather scratches very easily. Overall it’s ok.,3,111
"I thought the design was embroidered, so I was a caught off guard when it was just print. It fit fine, but I returned it because the bell sleeves made it awkward for me. It just wasn’t flattering on me at all.",3,209
cute and comfy.,3,15
"It's a good quality shirt...I like it, except I thought it was &#34;oversized&#34;. I wanted to wear it with leggings on Christmas Eve, but had to change, as it was too short (sleeves, the whole thing). I'll wear it with jeans instead.",3,235
It's a pretty scarf but not nearly as full as it looks in the photo. It is very narrow in reality.  I'm going to keep it because the lace is pretty but really wish it would've looked as it did in the photos.,3,207
"The tankini top fit great...However, the bottoms were very big for a size small!",3,80
I had got my normal size and it was kinda small... too tight 😫,3,62
I am 5'3 and 145lbs. I typically wear a medium. I wanted the dress to fit a tad loose a d have extra length so I ordered a large. It fits more like a small/medium. It fits  well just want it longer. I feel like any shorter and my lady bits would be exposed.,3,257
"Not the warmest gloves. Got cold pretty quickly (in temperatures down to -4 degrees F).<br />Even when the temp was warmer (10 to 20 degrees F), my sons' hands were numb after about an hour of snow play.",3,203
Absolutely loved it…until a band broke 2 months later,3,53
Wow these were way too tight. If I pull them up really High I can just barely button them but then I get serious camel toe. Lol<br />I will be returning them.<br />That being said they would be super cute if they fit.!,3,218
Was disappointed that the size was not true to really size! I ordered extra larg so I could wear shirt under! No can do it fits too tight to be able to wear any thing other than a bar.” The x-l is more like a medium,3,215
"Cute, but tiny. These were way too short and tight for my average size 4/5 child. Gave them away since returning them would’ve cost as much as shipping them here.",3,162
I purchased this product several months ago and should have returned it.  The shoulder harness is comfortable but the neck cords do not hold my alto saxophone securely.  It drifts down as I am playing.  I see no way to tighten it.,3,230
"Very cute purse, great quality, but it's too small. The opening is difficult to take my items out. Also, the handles are too small/short carry the bag on my arm. I returned it.",3,176
"I like the material and design of the sheath, but it does not fit my knife.",3,75
My son is 25lbs 2 toddler so he needs a small I got an extra extra small which was way to small. The shirt fits very tight so make sure you measure before purchasing because you may need to go a size up.,3,203
Cute handbag but too small for me,3,33
Looks good but the back doesn't stay in place it falls off bc too loose,3,71
"Too big for face gator, I will just sew the ear holes closed and use as a tube top.",3,83
"You have to wear white undies or no underwear, do to the pattern or different color undies showing through the light color of the dress. Other than that, I have received many compliments on the dress and it fits well and is stretchy fabric.",3,240
Nice color but poor quality,3,27
"Was very pretty, however, the shoulders were tight and the collar was very stiff and didn't lay well. I was disappointed and had to return it.  I ordered a small and I am 5'7"" and 145lbs.  The rest of the shirt fit well. I might have sized up if the collar had been less stiff.",3,277
"This is a very large fit.  I will be able to wear it with leggings, but only until that's no longer in style.",3,109
Watch band a bit too stiff,3,26
These seem smaller & thicker material than the other nurse mates socks I have. Not sure why this one is different but I don’t care for as much.,3,143
Arrived super fast and did what it was supposed to. Loved it when I frist put on the necklace but the extender broke the first time I used it.,3,142
"Not really sunglasses, which is what I thought they were.  Fit over glasses good!",3,81
"The picture is misleading, It appears to be able to be used with cufflinks however this is not the case. I was disappointed about this.",3,135
Not that bad...,3,15
"My husband loved the bracelet but after one, yes one day, the screw was stripped. Of course he’s afraid to wear it out, fearing the screw will fall out and the bracelet will follow.",3,181
"I find the fabric very uncomfortable and in need of constant ironing. It is also not the best fit for me,",3,105
Ice suit for price. Definatly not for the busty girls such as myself-42H I am a size 22 at Lane Bryant. This suit fits like maybe an 18-20 and pulls down on your chest.,3,168
"me encanta esta marca es la preferida de mi hijo vino con detalle en la costura, por lo que seria conveniente revisar los despachos",3,131
Too short and didn’t sit right on me. I’m 5”8,3,45
Just what I said above.<br />We will give it to our granddaughter in August for her 21st birthday.,3,98
Pretty cute but super wrinkly.,3,30
"The clips that attach to the mask's ear loops are plastic, and they don't latch or anything. I'm sure maybe the gap is for safety or ease of use, but I'd prefer it was more like a carabiner and latched securely. It can fall off easily.",3,235
Im 5'5 and 135 IBS . I had to get it tailored just a bit,3,56
because they are large they slip off.,3,37
"The wig is much thinner than the display photo, still workable. Soft and my head could breath so I wasn't completely roasted.",3,125
"I like this belt - it does stay flat and undetectable, but, because it's only an inch thick, it rides high. I feel like it would be better if it were 2&#34; thick. I still find myself hiking my jeans up.",3,203
Tiny,3,4
Not exactly as pictured. Sleeves are not as full and there is elastic around the bottom. On the plus side the top is lined and not sheer.,3,137
They’re great belts. Easy to use and comfortable. My only issue was the black one came with a scratch already on the belt. Other than that I’ve enjoyed them so far.,3,164
It started out very snug but the band lost elasticity w/in like a month. The material is also not that comfortable.,3,115
Cute but a little tight on the calves,3,37
"This head wrap is soft, comfortable and easy to put on. Only concern is that the pictures show the strands in the back as long and the wrap with some slouching. The product itself has short strands and does not slouch.",3,218
"This keeps happening to me over and over. I don't know when I will learn I always expect some thing larger than what I get from Amazon jewelry. I'm not going to return them. I am sure I can find times to wear them. But beware, often, earrings are smaller than they are represented to be.",3,287
"Cute but tight, not the best fabric :/",3,38
It’s not as soft as you’d expect. Not very fitting and came a little small. It’s comfy and warm but I wish it were softer and more smooth to the touch.,3,151
Beautiful & sophisticated,3,25
the width is good for my wide face,3,34
Not as cute as the photo but still nice.,3,40
"Im 5'2 @160 lbs with D cups and bought a large, because it said fits as expected, and it totally fits. So cute, love the women's cut, its super flattering. Wish they had more patterned T's that I liked.",3,202
Looked really cute but I am convinced the hook part did not hold unto my bag strong enough and I lost my keys the other bight.,3,126
The umbrella works as promised but the button to open it gets stuck constantly,3,78
The boys really like it. Fabric feels cheap though.,3,51
The front screws on and can pinch your earlobe. Will be uncomfortable at all times.,3,83
Material is thin and cheap. Stitching is poor. Fits a little loose and frumpy. But the color is vibrant and looks just like the picture. It’s probably only worth about $10-15.,3,175
bought these for surgery at hospital.  did not work.,3,52
Pants are good for the price but it is stupid they don’t waterproof the knees. I don’t understand the purpose.,3,110
The dress is ok but the colors are duller that what is picture on the site.,3,75
The bottoms fit perfectly. Although the top was entirely too small. I am slim but with an hour glass figure and I ordered a Medium. I wish I could have ordered different sizes without ordering two suits.,3,203
"These earrings are much smaller that shown in the photo of the woman wearing the earrings. They are sized for a young child. Other than that, they are quite pretty.",3,164
"I have mixed feelings. It is pretty dang cute, but I feel like the skirt is too wide and the waist is a bit tight. I'll still wear it, but it's a bit more cheaply made than I would prefer.",3,188
The dress is beautiful but it fit my mother too long and I'm a few inches taller and it still was too long... still she returned it she didn't like the way it looked on her because she is a little chubby.,3,204
these are adorable and they are a little small than my ear which are at 00G,3,75
Ordered a size 36 belt which is the size I always get and the size of pants I wear. The belt I received was about 2&#34; short. I had to give it to my son who wears a size of 32. The belt was a very nice and worth the money.,3,224
Small size up,3,13
Waste of money.  The flag pealed off in several areas after washing on delicate cycle.,3,86
These are very pretty but also very heavy. I can't wear them nor can my 2 daughters due to the weight. Took about 3 weeks to receive,3,132
sure.  meets basic expectation.,3,31
I loved this material and the fit was perfect but the elastic was several inches above my waistline so for me it wasn't comfortable. That's the only reason I am returning.,3,171
"This ran a little small for me, and was much shorter than expected. The bottom of the cardigan barely comes to my hips and I am average build and 5’8. It is a pretty thick material and not for a hot day. Overall, good quality but not true to what is shown in photo with length.",3,277
Daughter wears a size 5 shoe. Shoe is made at least 1 to 1.5 sizes to small. The right shoe LED controls are not functioning correctly. Have a request in to the manufacturer about exchanging them.,3,196
very small a little disappointed but gave to my sister whom liked the bigness of it,3,83
This is cute but just did not look good on me.,3,46
"Love the color.  The fit is snug, but, they are leggings after all. Just would have liked the material to be a bit thicker as these pants leave nothing to the imagination.  I had to return them.",3,194
Good quality and size.  I ordered VIOLET colored laces and unfortunately these are a true purple so I can’t use them.  Frustrating.,3,131
I kept these leggings but they are thin. When I bend my knee I can see my skin thru them. I only wear them whim my longer dresses. They will not work with a tunic unless you want your underwear to show threw.  Also the elastic waist band is thin and not comfortable.,3,266
Most of these do not light up at all. I have purchased them before and they were much better. Bad batch?,3,104
I'm too chubby for this dress but it looks good on my tall thin sister.,3,71
"Thin fabric, see through, wear an under tank top and leggings. Looks good on and it fits well.",3,94
"I loved the bikini top of this product. Just like the picture and the size fit great. However, the bottoms, though perfectly matching the picture and super cute were far too small. I ordered a medium and it squeezed and gave me a huge wedgie. I normally wear smalls in bottoms and 2 in pants.",3,292
"Very cute shoes.  Too narrow, too short.  I hope they will change them.  Just order larger size.",3,96
It was okay.,3,12
"My Grandson loved this item because of the dacal, but the shirt was very thin and seemed cheap.",3,95
Was very thin and didn’t fit me well. I returned.,3,49
"It was ok, really really big! I returned it.",3,44
Lower quality but you get what you pay for .,3,44
"Nice look, but the metal frame is a little flimsy.",3,50
Material is not soft. Very scratchy,3,35
Very cute glasses. Love the blue very deep and very polarized. My only thing for these glasses is the ugly black brim at the top of the glasses it looks like you have black eyebrows when you take pics other than that great,3,222
"It fits a little bit tighter for a bigger chested person. Otherwise, it is very pretty and a great dress for the summer.",3,120
There is too much lining inside.  You have to keep pushing it down.,3,67
"It's only 40 so far,  but honestly they are not any warmer than the ones I was replacing for those 30 days.. I got a size bigger and I still yank and yank to get them up.",3,170
"really cool idea, loved it from the moment I saw it. but very hard to keep in place at all, plus it doesn't feel so good when it slides off the ear and hangs by the single earring hole. loved it but ended up giving it to may daughter as it fit her better anyways.",3,263
The dress was already ruined.  Before I opened up the package,3,61
"Pro: Nice hat, very warm.<br /><br />Con: very small. I have an average size hat and it does not fit me. Have it to my 6yo instead.",3,131
Post bends way to easy.,3,23
I bought these socks for my daughter to use in a cosplay.  They fit like they did in the picture.  But I was disappointed in the quality.  My daughter is petite and you could see her skin through the socks.  For the cost I expected the socks to be thicker.,3,256
Cute little accessory,3,21
I loved the watch but the band is getting frayed and it can't be replaced according to my watch guy.  Its to unusual a size.,3,124
I have just tried these anti glare glasses one time so I can't say how well they work. I used them for local driving and not on a major highway where there would be many cars. They seemed to work for this one time but I don't really know for sure.,3,247
Just personal preference but it is too molded for my taste.,3,59
Wife likes them and they fit well even in an extra small.,3,57
"The pearl letter is cute and really makes a statement. However, the chain is very bright and cheap looking. The color is off as well- closer to a rose gold color.",3,162
I would recommend buying the next size up,3,41
Pants were perfect...top made a belly shirt 😂  its totally adorable so I'm keeping it.  Just dont expect the shirt to cover much of your child's stomach area.,3,158
"I bought this shirt for my son who is slender and has an athletic build. On average,  when I get him clothing, he wears a medium. I ordered this shirt in medium and it looked fine on him to me but he said it was a tight fit. He really likes the shirt but would have liked it to be slightly bigger.",3,297
Not bad. It’s really cute,3,25
Pretty dress great fabric just runs big!,3,40
"Were very cute for my 4 little girls ages 5,6,8 & 9 and they liked them to! I thibk the price could be a little cheaper though.",3,127
"I wore this dress to the rodeo. It’s pretty but do understand it’s cheap. I wore it once, washed it and the criss-Cross straps busted off in the washer. First time that’s happened to me 🙈",3,187
Pretty dress but sizing is way off. I bought my 5 year old daughter a size 5-6 dress and it is huge on her!,3,107
Used product for daily walk routine for fitness. But the material made me sweat way TOO much! They were soaked with sweat after just 5 min of walking. Also just sitting outside on a hot day - very sweat making material!!,3,220
I bought 2 different colors both in medium but only one fit. The smaller one felt like an extra small and I am unable to wear them. Thank God I only spent $5 each. Wouldnt recommend.,3,182
"Nice quality, comfortable. fits nicely however a little snug in the waist.",3,74
"Love the style of this top. I think it's a little less generous, length and width wise, than expected. The collar on it seems too small and I don't have a big neck. It feels very constricting",3,191
I bought for my 5 year old because she loves this show on the kids app. Too big but she loves it and wears it anyway.,3,117
These are super cute but they were wayyyy to big for my 7 year old. I ordered her usual size (size 11) but they were way to big. Gave them to my niece who wears a 12-13 and they fit nice on her.,3,194
"Slippery bottoms, not for indoor use. Like a felt bottom.",3,57
"They run on the small side, so get a size bigger",3,48
Way too large. I sure wish sizes were standardized.,3,51
"Great look, but I will say the very tips of the ear pieces catch on my hair almost every time I put them on. Kind of annoying.",3,126
"Beautiful dress, well made.<br />Dress was quite a bit longer and a little loose.<br />I am 5&#34;11 145 lbs 36A. I purchased a medium.<br />Washed in hot water and put in the dryer... Shrunk up and fits much better",3,215
It's a cute dress but the material is very thin and see through. It also pulls really easily so you get pieces of tinsely string hanging off. I haven't even worn it more than just trying it on because the fabric keeps catching,3,226
its a little flimsy but cute,3,28
Fit ok. Part of the sheer material was not stitched properly to the top,3,71
It was cute and has nice fabric. I wanted to yrade it for next size bigger but not available. Fits a lot smaller,3,112
"The skirt itself is cute and well-made. But it is WAY too small. At 5'2&#34; and 112 lbs, I'm a legit small, so based on the other comments I figured I'd be safe ordering it one size up. But I can barely get it buttoned. And it's a little too short for my taste.",3,262
good quality but I really didn't get to try it out because it was too small,3,75
cool style but broke in a few months.,3,37
When I received it I was expecting a better quality umbrella.  Design of the flower is very pretty.  It is very small.,3,118
I like that these fit and hold great. I don't like the zipper on top where it sticks out and shows through with a bulge.,3,120
Very pretty but not sturdy. May be able to squeeze a couple uses in with extra care. Feathers attached to cardboard so wings not flexible and easily permanently bent. Made it through the party intact though. Served it’s purpose but not for multi use.,3,250
"Liked the style and the look of the bracelet...but up close, the black bead is made to look cheap by the  aluminum (?) metal and the way it is cut.  Liked everything about it except that and that's a big THAT!",3,209
"They're too big to be compression (they're size small) . I also feel like my other gloves with magnets are more effective. Though they do give me some relive,  hence the 3 stars.",3,178
some come dead while others are dim but for the price you cant expect much. I've moved on to a more professional light thats not so bulky.,3,138
I will think about this one before i even open the second one i got. Like them but a size larger would make me really happy. I will try.,3,136
Fell apart after wearing 2xs loved them but now worthless to me.,3,64
It's got a very long handle so easy to push at the airport. However the computer sleeve is too small for my 14 inch computer. It does fit underneath the airline seats well,3,171
"The right earring is very pretty and the left earring is very pretty.  However, the body of the dragonfly is not curved in the same manner on both earrings.  I am very disappointed in this, but will try to adjust and wear them anyway.  Quality control needs to be improved with this seller.",3,290
"Very Cute! I normally wear a size Large, but ordered up a size to an XL. It actually fits like a medium",3,103
"I think this would be a wonderful piece, but unfortunately I need a bigger size.  It fits, but snugger than I like, so I can comfortably say, don't be afraid to size up, you will not be unhappy with that choice.",3,211
Love the colors but it says sweatshirt material and the bottom doesn’t stretch. Very snug.,3,90
The  zippers on the  pockets  snag the arms of the jacket  and with this  material  it leaves a nag and small  rips. Really sucks cause I really like the jacket..,3,162
I didn't realize when I ordered it that it's gold and not silver.,3,65
misleading size description. Otherwise just fine.,3,49
Length and sizing is OK. I am just not impressed with the neck area; fits like a bib draped tightly across my neck.,3,115
It's a nice lightweight backpack and serves its purpose but did not come with the first aide kit as advertised.,3,111
I would have liked the edges to have been more finished. But it will do the job.,3,80
"We are all familiar with this beautiful painting.  Unfortunately, the dress is too dark and it does not display a distinction between the beautiful orange, green and blue.  The dress is more like a monochromatic dark blue greenish.  :(",3,235
It fit really cute but the zipper material was cheap. My zipper broke,3,69
The three stars are for fitment and price. Definitely not polarized as they claim.,3,82
Looks nice and feels comfy,3,26
Runs large. Bought a small for my daughter who is 5ft and it is very large on her.  Otherwise it would be a cutr dress,3,118
"It didn't fit as expected. However, good product",3,48
NOT ONLY WAS THE SIZE SMALLER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT IT WAS CHEAP AND TACKY.,3,82
The legs are a bit short. I don't have terribly long legs and these are more capris length on me. Other than that they are great. Color stays. Squat proof and great control top.,3,177
I was really excited to get these in my hands but the keychains are mirrored irl and the ones with text do not look good. For some of them it doesnt matter but it may bother a few.,3,180
Cute .. but too loose... i ordered small still quite baggy... returning,3,71
Fit well but a light material,3,29
"i have no problem with the quality of the pants, just the size chart.  I ordered a size 10 for my 9 year old, who is of average build and  short for his age.  The pants were too short and the waist too small.  I then got a size 14, which fit.",3,242
"The color shown on the model was a 'forest green' but the description said emerald.  I bought it according to the picture.  Wrong,  It is emerald green.  Also, the sleeves are rather tight so I had trouble getting it over a long sleeved shirt.",3,243
Very basic quality dress.. No stretch in the cloth at all.. Going back!,3,71
Lovely pearls. Purchased as a gift and think they will be received well. On the downside the packaging...the box the necklace was in came open in the shipping box and the necklace was loose in the box!!  Three stars because the necklace was loose in the box.,3,258
Have bought several over the years and they have been good. This one the pocket ripped the first time I put something in it.,3,124
"This bra fits true to size with comfortable rib cage adjustment. Shoulder straps adjustments are easy to use, non-bulky and don't itch. The best and worst feature of this bra are the side panels. While the fabric allows for heat release, there is no support.",3,258
"I was so excited to get this sweatshirt because I loved the colors. It was to small around the under arms and the upper chest other then that it fit well, and it was soft inside. I'm 5'3 and a half at 159 lbs. So I was pretty upset.",3,232
"The overall quality seems very good and the material is really nice, but the fit around the legs is super tight. If you like that, great - I'll be returning them.",3,162
I have this dress in an identical but sleeveless style from “Guberry” & it’s perfect in every way.  This one fits oddly.  The chest & sleeves were super tight but the waist was too loose.  I’ll just wear a sweater with the “Guberry” dresses because life is too short for ill fitting clothes.,3,291
The quality of the shoe was ok.,3,31
I like the waist trimmer.,3,25
"Very difficult to put on, but once you get them on, then they work really well.",3,79
"These would be better as a flat back.  Not sure why most cartilage jewelry has a ball backing and not flat back.  The ball irritates the CRAP out of my ear.  Never had any issues with the flat backs I've purchased, elsewhere, previously.",3,237
This shoe is not true to size.  It fits extremely large.  I ordered a girls 4.5 and it fits like a women's 6.5/ 7. I'll need to order a 2.5 for it to fit correctly.,3,164
Good material and the colors didn't bleed in the wash.  I only gave 3 stars because it took 30 days to arrive.,3,110
A bit cheap looking but not to bad for the money..The string necklace doesnt tie well thats the only issue ive had.,3,115
Gets the job done for scuffs and other markings. For me I used it for quite sometime now and I've washed my shoes a lot with the bottle given. After a while like any other shoe it got dirty but this product can clean your shoe no problem,3,237
Very difficult to shorten band. Took me about an hour. Still isn't right but I'll take it to a jeweler next time.,3,113
For people with small heads it may slip off easily.,3,51
Haven't had it very long and the card slats st the bottom have already ripped,3,77
Make sure you have on the right bra. It also rides/scrunches a lot,3,66
"The bean is ok, the sound is good, but my biggest issue is the bluetooth, it keeps disconecting, when it pairs if i put my phone screen to sleep to keep listening to Spotify or YouTube, it gets unpaired, and have to redo the pairing several times to actually hear it for longer time",3,282
Can’t keep it on,3,16
I got 2 different sizes from Prime Wardrobe to see which one would fit better.  The smaller one was too small and the larger one was way too big.  No luck with this brand anymore.  Had to return both.,3,200
"- not really a sweatshirt,  more of a warm thick long sleeve shirt<br />- low quality (see pics of strings / stitching along zipper)<br />- zipper access for boobs are not ideal for my large beasts ... it is awkward to get boobs out",3,232
"Basic flip flops, used them back & forth to the pool for 3 months before they started to discolor. Won't clean up.",3,114
"Ehhh ok....don't seem to block sun and pictured as blue mirror lenses but not mirrored. Probably won't end up wearing. Great packaging and super fast shipping though, thanks",3,173
Too thin and flimsy..,3,21
A bit to. Snug,3,14
Kinda odd with the long string to tie. It’s very thin material and it faded after one wash.,3,91
"Hat is shaped weird. Same price as buying from the Harley dealer, but shaped weird. Not too Satisfied.",3,102
Emblem and earings too small for even medium size man,3,53
It's a cute bag. Leather is very soft but I don't think it's for daily use. I feel the leather will come off if it's used daily.,3,128
"It's cool, but I prefer for fitted cap",3,38
a little more flimsy for me.  but for the price it will do.,3,59
Was not impressed with this shirt. I have ordered a few others from the seller and this one seemed very cheap,3,109
Nice looking mask.  Good quality.  But the size was smaller than expected.  The fit was a bit tight on the head and the jaw line seemed small to me.  Other than that nice purchase.  Would buy again for a child or teen.,3,218
"I was under the impression i was buying little girl socks, but they fit me... A woman who wears size 8 shoes..  Decent quality though",3,133
It's ok not bad...,3,18
I like the look & design but it's too small for my size 8 head.,3,63
It was a little bigger than I expected but still nice. Would not fit into some smaller purses.,3,94
Definitely see through. I got the black color. They fit perfect I love it  the tummy control is perfect.,3,104
"Finally found a sizing chart located among the pictures and I will not be able to wear any of the line for probably a year. A large is an 8-10, which in the real world, is a medium",3,180
Really nice a lot of different size and colors to chose from.,3,61
These compression pants ran very small.,3,39
"One of the most comfortable bras I've ever worn, but both the black and pink had a seam tear in under two months. Still worth it for $12 if you don't mind mending once in a while",3,178
Did not like that most of them were Christmas themes. That was not clear when I purchased them so I can't use most of them and have to wait until Christmas to try and use them,3,175
Too small and no give,3,21
The post is short so it's really difficult to get the ball screwed on but it looks super cute!,3,94
Made for a teenager.,3,20
"Kept fingers warmer by being a mitten style although dexterity is somewhat reduced. Thumbs got cold. Heater pocket is strangely on back of hand,severely reducing effectiveness of hot hands. Ended up just putting them inside glove where they lumped up and floated around.",3,270
Cute shoe but very cheaply made. I have two pair of these and one the insoles fell apart within two weeks and the other pair the shoes actually fell apart after about a month. Neither pair were worn daily either so they weren’t worn much.,3,238
You'll have to wear a camisole with this. The pink isn't as bright as shown.,3,76
"Like, but oversized - ordered small and they are too big",3,56
"The hat is nice, but the bill is small.  When worn it looks like it should be on a kids cap.  Fortunately, my father did not care.  I am the critical one, but my daughter who is 11 is the one who told me to take it back it looks too small.  My father kept it and does wear it.",3,276
"Well the quality is great and I really like it! But I ordered it specifically because it was a cheeseburger, not pizza... don't get me wrong, I love pizza and I don't plan on returning it. None the less it's not what I ordered. Oh well",3,235
"I can not say whether or not it helps , I have gained so much weight that it did not fit .",3,90
Cute and comfortable!,3,21
Seems a bit big. Hoping it will shrink some,3,43
They are pretty and everything but won't stay in place,3,54
The material of the sweater is slightly thin. But overall this is a good soft sweater for a decent price.,3,105
Fits smaller than expected but I ordered a larger size just in case &amp; it fits perfectly.,3,92
"Cheap. While adjusting the wrist strap, it was torn. They lasted through the winter before that just fine though.",3,113
To tight for a mans neck . But good for a little kid.,3,53
I bought 2 - black and red. The red is perfect and looks great. The black has no give! I couldn’t get my head through the neck hole! I wish they were a little more consistent with thier product.,3,194
Looks decent.  The bottom &#34;Giants&#34; part I had to add adhesive because the adhesive that was on it was peeling off but other than that. Nice,3,147
"I am only giving this 3 stars because i thought it was a thicker sweater than it was. However, when i went to look back it did say T shirt. So, hahah. It fits great and goes nicely for a light cover up or something. I like it and I am glad i made the purchase.",3,260
"Cute for one or two accation,one if the ankle bracelets broke before I put it on,It looks kinda like real gold, just not close up:/",3,131
Super cute print and nice length however the elastic twists - almost unwearable. Any tips on how to fix it?,3,107
The ring is the best art of the necklace if u do wear it a lot the string will give out mine broke after wearing it a few times.,3,128
good for the price but i normally wear M and ordered L because i read the reviews before and it is small still,3,110
"Got great comments on this dress when I wore it. Comfortable on my 5'7 frame, however I don't mind wearing shorter dresses with flats.",3,134
used for jeans and cargo pants,3,30
"Was soft as advertised, but the color wasn't true to the photo. Also, no label; was giving it as a gift, and I would  have preferred something that would let the receiver know the materials.",3,190
Pretty and hangs well.  A little snug in the arms for XL ladies. But I hate the feel of the fabric. Scratchy and kind of slick.,3,127
They made your skin turn green,3,30
Cute design.. but they are too small,3,36
"No true to fit, runs small.",3,27
"Found these were a tight around the ankle, especially the pattern styled ones. Struggled to get the zebra ones on my foot, felt a bit like one of Cinderellas' step sisters trying to get it on. Cute styles though, color matches the image. My shoe size is a Womans 9.",3,265
"Cute shoes, but the back on the shoe rubs on the lower part of leg making them painful to wear. I've tried wearing with taller socks and still feels awkward. Disappointed that they aren't comfy.",3,194
Low quality. Ordered an XXL normally wear a medium still pretty tight,3,69
"I love the color,the texture of the fabric and the style but the inseam is no way as long as the picture shows,I put a tape measure on it and s it's 3"" .I wish they were longer . Will donate them don t want to wait another month for a refund being they ship from china.",3,269
"But that's the trouble with a stretchy material.  With an Apple Watch 6 you have to ensure somewhat of a snug fit in order to properly track heart rate and such.  This was comfortable, but it always kept slipping on my wrist.",3,225
Beautiful and fit very well ONCE YOU WIGGLE INTO IT!!!  Really cute but no zipper or other way to open the dress for putting it on easily.,3,138
The top is lovely but the dress is too blousy and shapeless. I tried a belt but the dress just doesn’t quite work with it.,3,122
This shoe was a bit wide for my daughter’s feet.,3,48
"This product looks like it does in the photos. However, the material is very cheap and feels almost like the inside of a swimsuit.",3,130
"I loved this bathing suit UNTIL I washed it, the blue bleeds into the white causing it to look dirty. I was super disappointed because it fits so well and is perfect for water sports. Great coverage but can only wear once after washing.",3,236
Material takes forever to dry.,3,30
"I wasn't very satisfied with my slippers, they are already starting to come apart at the seams",3,94
The face shields didn’t fit the cap. Too small. But item was in good condition and seller respond fast and complete the return without a problem,3,144
I returned this dress because the draw string at the waist is fake. It's literally a knot you tie.,3,98
"Does not fit sizes are not as described gave to my daughter in law, she loves it",3,80
it came too big but it worked well for airsoft since i wanted to wear a sweatshirt underneath,3,93
"I usually fit 34b and read the reviews and went on a lim and got 34b. It looks great but the cups are too big and the band fits okay, not snug like it should be :( going to try to exchange it for a smaller size.",3,211
"Cute purse lot smaller thenbit looks, but all in all a very nice product.",3,73
While it is pretty the band broke in less than a month. Very disappointed,3,73
"Very small stones, perfect for a necklace.  Very good quality and polished almost flawless.<br /><br />The size is less or equal to a 5 cent nickel.<br /><br />Very good looking, if they were twice or four times the size they would be super perfect!",3,249
Short front shows midriff. Did not want that,3,44
Nice price&colors<br />To small,3,31
"Nice necklace, but was disappointed that the chain goes through the heart, and is not affixed to the sides. Pic depiction isn’t 100% correct.",3,141
The lace on the bottom at the seam area needed repair.  I can sew so no problem for me.,3,87
Costume jewelry,3,15
Very pretty . A little lightweight .,3,36
"This bra runs SUPER SMALL. It barely covers my nipples and I know why they give you the extender, because 9 out of 10 people will need to use it.<br />I wouldn't recommend this. I kept it but will have to literally tape my boobs when I use it",3,242
"It’s warm , not see through. Color is nice and just like shown",3,62
Hard material.,3,14
Was great when it first arrived.  It now after a few washings it's all out of shape and fits like a rug. It's a shame cause it was wonderful at first.,3,150
Pretty but very long plug; i have to use an Oring and still have lots of plug left. They are also a lot bigger than I expected.  Like tad smaller than a dime.,3,158
Beautiful colors but scarf is a square and can not be wrapped around neck like a traditional scarf.,3,99
It took forever to get here the design was not as the photo had shown the material was cheap and the has are goofy looking.,3,123
Not as thick as I wanted it to be,3,33
Nice but a bit large..Fits well when tucked in like the model pic.,3,66
ordered a size 1x and the shorts were like a M other then that it's perfect.,3,76
Wasn’t super impressed with these. Had to return as they are  Definitely a little on the big side.,3,98
"They are just ok. Seem to be the correct strength and I have no idea if the blue light filter is working but it might be. The glasses are very flimsy, I suppose it’s good that they are not heavy but I’m hoping they don’t break easy. One good thing is they don’t look as cheap as they feel.",3,289
It's a cute top. I really like it.,3,34
"Runs small, great style.  Prefer golf skorts to have a back pocket.",3,67
"Pattern is great and I usually like this brand. However, I ordered two and this one is significantly larger. Meaning.... it slips off. For $15, would think better quality control.",3,179
I'm 5'4 and 152 lbs these are pretty sheer on me.,3,49
Was not big enough as per my daughter.,3,38
I did not receive the same shoe as pictured.,3,44
"Super cute, didn't really stay off my shoulder though.  Fit as expected.",4,72
Good material  and love it to wear everyday,4,43
"So far so good for one week. What remains to be seen is how long the spring to shut the case works. With all previous eye glass cases I've purchased, the spring seems to break quickly. Sometimes it was only a month and others a week. We shall see,no pun intended.",4,263
Comes in a beautiful case. Love the length.  I can leave it as opera length or make a double strand choker. Very perfect uniform pearls.,4,136
"Pendant was slightly smaller than expected, but really cute. Gave it as a gift and she really liked it.",4,103
"I am 5'7 148 lbs and purchased the medium.  If I had to do it over again, I would buy a large just so that it would fit more loosely but overall its a beautiful shirt.",4,167
It was a gift and I heard she liked it,4,38
"Pretty and comfy, just too long for my 5’3” self. Fabric has a lot of stretch",4,77
"Great cardigan! Lightweight, thin material but still looks professional. After reading previous comments, I ordered a size bigger and it fits perfectly!",4,152
Got this for my brother who does Taekwondo and my boyfriend who is a gym rat. They say they love the vest and have become sweat kings. They are pleased with the vest and I am pleased with my purchase.,4,200
Great for the price. They fit well.,4,35
Love this but the one shoulder strap was sewn twisted.,4,54
Love  this jacket! It is so comfortable and fits perfectly. It is very well made and the material soft. Wore it out on a cold winter night in NY and kept me warm and cozy,4,170
They are really cute and comfortable,4,36
Took several months to arrive.  Quality is comparable to the price.,4,67
"This ring is very pretty but for a person with small hands, the settings are a bit big. They are constantly rubbing on my fingers on either side.  I'm keeping it but will probably only wear it for short periods of time.  The price was right though!",4,248
"Pretty dress for the money.  Has that vintage retro look I was looking for.  Material is a little thin, but is not see-through at all.  Just may need a sweater in the colder months.",4,181
Nice sturdy glasses,4,19
Great for the value,4,19
"I love these pants, but they run a bit too long. I'm 5' 6&#34; and I am constantly walking on the bottoms.",4,106
"It's, alright. Great gloves warms, yet I wish it would be a little tighter, on the hands. The material is excellent, I wish it would be a little tight surface...",4,161
Perfect fit in medium for my little brother.,4,44
They look pretty nice and are quite durable! Some of the keychains though you can tell were glued on. Never knew it glowed until I played around one day with them. Definitely will buy again!,4,190
Love this sweater but it’s so itchy. Works well with a long sleve shirt underneath. Other than that it’s a great sweater.,4,121
Comfy and warm the patterns are a little hard to see but wasn’t a big issue,4,75
It an elastic bracelet with medal spikes. My wrist is 6.5 and it just fits but I still feel a pinch now and then.,4,113
"Love the the Jim halo were them on my birthday, bar hoping.",4,59
Really nice option from the originals. I am a mechanic and the pink one I gave to my friend who is a avid runner. Very breathable makes all day wear a breeze.,4,158
I love this dress just wish it was a little longer. The fit was great.,4,70
I knew these socks would be too large for me but I ordered them anyway.<br />They're made for Women's shoe size 9 and up.  But I wear a size 7. Please also offer  these for the smaller shoe range sizes. They are so nice and warm!,4,229
"Well made, nice fitting waistband, quality fabric - a great value!",4,66
"Item, to me, is not really sweat pants.  The item is thin an light weight more like work out clothing and not your standard style sweat pants.  I do like them so far and are great to work out in if you don't want to wear shorts in the cold months.  I would recommend this item.",4,277
It felt great but 2 inches too small,4,36
"Nice sweater, not entirely pleased with the quality of knit, but was given as gift and the receiver likes it.",4,109
"Love this dress, only thing is wash it first or it dyes your skin a blue color",4,78
Great full face shield but the dark eyelets make it hard to see in low light.  But great look! Very thin as well.,4,113
"I have absolutely no complaints about this dress - it’s comfortable with pockets and plenty of stretch, seems well made, and the fit is flattering. For me, though, the t-shirt-like short sleeves work best for younger women and more casual settings—not quite business casual, in my opinion.",4,289
"It is a little tight, but I think with time it will stretch and will be perfect!",4,80
Nice glasses for the price!,4,27
My 8 year old loved these for about 2 weeks - he was teased a bit by his older friends unfortunately. Good deal for the price - lights are cool.,4,144
It fit but it rolls up from the belly up to the chest...think pantyhose rolling on ur belly? Yeah under ur boobs...not a good feeling. But still my daughters r skinny n love the bras...so withthe right body type they r great bras!,4,230
"love the color, guess I should have noticed how the models boobs pop out, because mine does too, another camisole purchase",4,122
Perfect size for my purse.,4,26
Loved this hat - great for the Kentucky Derby Wedding I recently attended!,4,74
Nice. Knot could be a bit more substantial but good buy for a bad hair day.,4,75
Gorgeous & very high quality . Looks like a very expensive piece,4,64
I didn't like the material it was making me feel hot and it was a bit itchy,4,75
"I love it, the only problem I'm having is the hook keeps unlatching from the zipper part of the wallet, other than that I love it",4,129
For the price this is a nice sundress. I wear it often. My only complaint is one of the straps ripped away from the fabric. It was sewn back on easily and I continue to wear it all the time.,4,190
Very sturdy but also heavy,4,26
"First I must say, this dress is nice and the quality is good. The bust of the dress was on the small side and it is very long but that can be fixed with heals. There are no zippers but it stretches. I love the colour I ordered. To conclude, this purchase is a good one i recommended it.",4,286
"the item met all my expectations, all items are of very good quality, respond to all questions and the service was great thanks",4,127
Comfy slippers.,4,15
I really like this bag .The  Front pocket has 2 sections. One for my keys the other for my cell phone plus  4 other sections in the purse. Plenty big but not to big. Wide shoulder strap so it doesn't hurt your shoulder .  Genuine leather.,4,238
for the money these are decent sunglasses so good job,4,53
"I ordered 2 sets of these for christmas gifts. Arrived on time, nicely packaged, and as advertised.",4,99
It's great. Beautiful print and fit!,4,36
"I like this top, its vintage and fits comfy.. a bit too big, but its still cute",4,79
I purchased these to protect my forearms from dog bites and scratches. (I am a dog trainer.)<br />These are tight and difficult to put on for me (woman).<br />I can't imagine how hard it would be for a muscular man to use.,4,222
It was the perfect dress for my Shreck fairy godmother Halloween costume. It runs a little big around the shoulders but I really couldn’t ask for more at this price.,4,165
It makes llookibg for my keys easy enough,4,41
Love it. Because of very thin strap and large face.,4,51
"This is a nice bag. I am having second thoughts. I returned it, but should kept it. I probably will buy it again.",4,113
need to re size it little bit smaller,4,37
Very flattering jeans.,4,22
Like the dress. Will have to work with a different bra so it will not show. Glad I purchased one size bigger than my normal because of the tighter fit.,4,151
"works fine, band is wide & a little loose, but better than too tight.  seems to keep good time, only had it for a month, no problems.",4,133
I feel it could have fit better if the thing part of the sandal was brought a little more forward. The bow is super cute I love them overall,4,140
Smaller than mentioned size.  Get one size bigger.,4,50
"Nice fit, loved the color.Length is decent. Good material.Gives shape to my body and cover my tummy.Pretty good for the price.Perferct for summer.I received this dress on a discount for my unbiased review.",4,205
I really love these. I wear a women’s 7.5/8 and these fit perfect. They are super soft and don’t feel cheap. The o my reason I deducted a star is because when you put them in the color gets weird stretched out.,4,210
Kinda cheap looking but I still really like it,4,46
"This shirt is gorgeous and the body of it fits perfectly, but the straps are really loose. Will definitely have to hem them.",4,124
"A little roomy, but wife says very warm and she's happy with it.",4,64
"Didn’t like the fitted look, not a good color got me",4,52
The silk satin pajamas are just what I was looking for. It runs true to size and is cute and comfortable.<br />It is also easy to care for. Washes well and comes out looking new.,4,178
"Great gloves, but too small for me.  Hand to return.",4,52
"I ordered the size 8. Im 5'7, 150 lbs and it fit great. The straps need to be loosened a bit to put on. You can go braless or buy a strapless bra but make sure it connects low in the middle, the chest is deeper than i expected.",4,227
"The charms are exactly as described but with all my purchases, I count the quantity. I was missing 3 charms. It may sound a tad anal but if the description says 100 thats what i expect to be in my package.",4,205
"Perfect size, well-made and great colored stripes",4,49
These are cool...they get frayed kind of easy after washing but they are really cute and soft. I use them mostly for the gymz,4,125
My daughter owned another pair if these boots previously. She loved them so much that when her old ones finally started showing wear and tear we bought another pair. They are stylish and comfortable.,4,199
"Nice, breathable material.  Light weight.  Runs a little small and snug when aroundthe neck.  Bought these for my 10 year old son to wear to school around his neck since Covid so he didn't need to keep remembering where he put his mask but it may be to snug to wear all day.",4,274
a lot bigger than I thought but its really not heavy. Very beautiful! Although 2 months and the chain broke,4,107
It's cute and what I wanted. Only wish it was a flowy at the bottom like the picture portayed it to be. The price was high for a t-shirt in my opinion.,4,151
"Exactly as described, but personally felt shorter than I would have preferred; not that you could see anything due to the shorts part under it but just not my personal look. Also wish both sides had pockets",4,206
"The pads for the chest are too small to be of any use, but the shirt looks great otherwise",4,90
it is a nice produce with plenty of space. it looks smaller than it is in reality. I think it is a good deal,4,108
A cute basic tee with a twist. This is comfortable and really cute. I think the length is perfect and it's not too thin. I can see myself wearing it a lot.,4,155
usually us size med-large fits great not too tight just wish it were cotton.,4,76
The fabric was very soft to the point of being too soft and easily stuck to my mouth and lips.,4,94
"Pretty watch but the clasp comes undone while wearing it sometimes, so you have to be careful it doesn't fall off & break.",4,122
It's absolutely gorgeous on me it fits great.its complicated to figure out at first with no instructions so I had to look at the picture and after a few mins I got it.when I bought it it came very late I had to contact them and they sent a new one but other than that I love it,4,277
I ordered the large and it definitely ran on the small side. I reordered up to XL and hopefully that will work. I gave it 4 stars bc it’s a nice weight fabric and the graphics were nicely saturated with color and also were of good quality,4,238
Super cute shoes but they flop off my heels so they will not be worn...,4,71
I bought these to wear under button up shirts. Bought a size smaller than i normally wear. They look great as they have a higher collar than regular tank top/undershirts. It is not a traditional tank top fit but they work very well for my purposes.,4,248
Very cute belts.  Love it.,4,26
"Stretchy, easy to get on and off. So far I haven't had a rash like other watch bands",4,84
Exactly has described and pictured. Comfortable fit and style. Definite must have.,4,82
"Work well, but almost too big for the 5 1/2 size ring.",4,54
"Beautiful color, but edges are smooth and stone appears to be dried out.<br /><br />For the price, decided to keep.",4,115
Good quality. Good price.,4,25
Boyfriend loves it. The colors could be brighter. Looks pretty much all black when I ordered grey and black,4,107
Fits a little small...go up one size.,4,37
"Cute, a little on the bigger side.",4,34
Adorable dance bag. Small. Perfect for ages 2-4.,4,48
"In my opinion, the instruction booklets should be larger, with stronger print, and perhaps a little editing of the contents.",4,124
Very nice and warm...slides down a little but do recommend these,4,64
"This is a SILVER metal keychain fob - with black leather accents.  Photo appears white, but that is misleading.<br />Works well.",4,128
Need to exchange them but good boots but ran kinda small,4,56
Adorable and so comfortable,4,27
"Love this dress, I purchased an xsmall and it fits perfectly and is the perfect length.",4,87
"Cute top, but the material is a bit stiff. Also, the fit is shorter and wider than in the picture. It only hangs just below the waistline, not at the hips as shown. 3.5 stars.",4,175
They work and the way they fit the glasses.,4,43
"Very beautiful, came with only one larger stone missing but you can't tell since it's such a busy necklace.",4,107
"I love pearls and these are beautiful.  I wish they were a touch larger, but they are still beautiful and feel really comfortable on my ears.  I have to wear at least 14K so they don't bother my ears and these are perfect.",4,222
Cute suit for the price.  Not super supportive up top but still cute for a fun suit.,4,84
It is definitely a teenager's dress. Anyone older must have a perfect figure and be not afraid to show more than usual - the dress a bit too short.,4,147
"The shirt is longer than it looks in the picture, and can almost be worn as a dress if wanted. I'ts nice though!",4,112
A little big for my 5 year old for baseball but will work. He loves feeling like a &#34;pro&#34; in them.,4,105
Super cute size up,4,18
But one size smaller as medium is still a little loose for me,4,61
"Small, but the dementions are listed. So I was not dispointed. Bought it for my boyfriend as a gift.  Wanted one for myself because the small size would be perfect for a ladies necklace.",4,186
Good watch for the price. Light weight. Built in light is lacking.,4,66
Great fit.  Love the top. The bottom is a tad see through only in the back. The front has extra fabric. I don’t know why it does go all the way around.,4,151
"It’s a great shirt! I love it but it is slightly lighter than picture. Also, ordered large and it is a bit small but my fiancé is usually medium so I’m glad I ordered large... order a size up",4,191
I thought these were cotton and spandex but I was wrong! the size is true! the material is silk!,4,96
Well made and plenty of extra room for other items,4,50
Cute. looks just like the picture.,4,34
"for gradeschool it is okay but not what I would wear, my granddaughter liked it.",4,80
Gift for granddaughter and she loved them.,4,42
"Exactly what I ordered, but I didn't realize it was going to start falling apart after wearing two times. :-(",4,109
Good for the money. Bought two pair for my 8.5 year old who plays travel ball. He loves them and they fit great. For the money well worth it. We have used them for a month and haven't scratched broke or lost them yet. Colors were a bonus.,4,238
I like the look,4,15
Comfortable. It's a Slip! Could wear it under a dress or skirt if necessary.,4,76
Came fast and they look great,4,29
These are cute and durable.  I used it for  upper ear cartilage and it is great.  I can sleep in it in and not even notice it.  Great purchase for the price!,4,157
"These are nice Sports Shorts however they do run small. However, to be fair, not everyone can wear boy shorts",4,109
"My child is 18 months and has a pretty big head, but they’re still slightly too big for him. Hopefully by 2 they fit!",4,117
"Use this for Mardi Gras, didn't read until afterwards that the tights was for shorter women. I'm 5' 8"" so I had to cut my feet out the toe to make longer. But apart from that they where great.",4,192
Run small.pleace go up a size or two I'm a 14 got an xl I'm once cheese burger away from it not fitting,4,103
"Due to the text style and positioning, the sizes do not line up with the actual calors/tapers. Get good at counting or just memorize them, haha.",4,144
"This dress was too tight across bust and I am only a 38 C. Also the style put emphasis on belly, may be good for a maternity dress but not for someone with a belly.",4,164
"Nice umbrella, a little smaller than I thought it would be",4,58
This costume was a little loose. I am 5'8 178. I received alot of compliments on this costume.,4,94
The fit iz perfect ...,4,22
I like this hat it’s supper cute and works great with buns or ponytails! It was a little big and the sides went a bit past my ears but nothing I couldn’t deal with. Mainly wore it for working out,4,195
Ok just a O K,4,13
"I love the style & especially the pockets. However, the neckline is a bit higher than I thought. These are great for going out.",4,127
Good materials comfortable,4,26
"Dress is cute, as pictured. It does fit like a normal small, there is just not a ton of stretch.  The material in the neckline isn’t sewn down so It flips up.",4,158
"It fits perfect, exactly what I was looking for, and I love the cheap price",4,75
Better fit than expected and great casual look,4,46
Loved the colors. Stretchy fit. I am 5'3 so idk if it was because I am short or if the size I  ordered was too big but I we large and it was actually too big. Falling off. Will order from this company again,4,206
It was a little smaller than expected but it actually Fits a lot better very warm,4,81
Nice lanyard but kind of stiff. The clips are a little stiff as well. But it does the job and keeps your mask around your neck for easy retrieval.,4,146
Hecka see throught.,4,19
I get lots of compliments on it every time I wear it,4,52
Little tight but the lining on the inside that is soft and has extra around the ears is great!,4,94
"I've only had them a few days, and I used one of them for the left side of my nose. It fits well, but man, it was a bitch closing it. Once I got it closed, its stayed put.",4,171
As a bracelet it is to small for my wrist,4,41
This is my first pair of compression socks and they are very comfortable and well worth the money.,4,98
"Like previous reviews, it's a little smaller than you might think. And the chain is a little short for me. But I'm a larger lady, and it does fit.",4,146
"Very comfortable feel and fit. Fits as expected. Simple, but love that the twist at the front adds some style to it. I'd definitely purchase again!",4,147
"Yo soy de una altura de 5,4 y peso 146 libras, e pantalon me quedo justo a la medida, tiene una tela muy fresca, solo que cuando me lonpondo parece que la parte de la cintura se va a romper. Lobde para correr y no me causó ningún problema",4,238
"Cute, fluffy, but not big enough",4,32
"I love all things purple, and this is no exception. The pendant itself is beautiful! For as little as it is, it might be slightly weighted. The necklace is pretty short so you’ll mostly likely want to get an extender. I will be.",4,228
I bought these for my ole man to wear this christmas he loves them except the fact that they are fleece and super hot.,4,118
"While it's very pretty, it's a bit large, chunky, if you will.  I would have like an instruction card to better utilize the mysteries.  Other than that, I think it's lovely and would recommend it for someone like me who is getting to know the Rosary.",4,250
Pretty but I lost them somehow,4,30
"You actually get two of these, a nice bonus (although I really only need 1). Cheap price, and decent quality. I used this to check my plants for sexing and flowering progression and they do the trick.",4,200
It was a Father's day gift for my father from my son and he loved it!,4,69
Hoping to have fun with the idea for the beach wedding,4,54
"Vans are fine, shipped quickly.",4,31
The cord is strong and can hold a heavier badge than most cords.,4,64
Satisfied with this purchase.  No buyers remorse.  The pants were a little large but not uncomfortable.  They were used for international travel and performed well.  Quality construction.  I would recommend them to a friend.,4,224
"Nice smock to work in, very comfortable fit. It is not real thick where you would get hot. It is breathable.",4,108
It's super cute but smaller than expected. Returned and ordered bigger one. Now love it.,4,88
The material is very see through!,4,33
I love it.but it looks a bit flimsy.so im hopeing it dont crack.but its really cute otherwise.,4,94
"Nice top. Good length, thick enough do you don’t see a bra through it. I just really like it in white.",4,102
BONITAS NO ESTA MAL,4,19
"This shirt is a great weight but a bit on the small side.  Although it fits, it is very snug.",4,93
Exactly what I needed! Took no time at all to arrive. Good quality will be ordering more. We always need goggles as are family is very outdoorsy and we are avid riders.,4,168
Very nice earrings and not at all too small.,4,44
Not sure why anypne needs two of these - waste of materials.,4,60
fit is a bit small,4,18
Love them. Non binding as advertised,4,36
"Not what I expected, but it’s ok",4,32
My daughter in law loved it.  The face was too big for my small wrist.,4,70
Color was a little lighter than in the picture but still pretty . Dress runs small . I wear an 8 and the extra large is perfect,4,127
I love variety that they give. I have no duplicates.,4,52
"Snug, but adorable. Thin material but can't see through. Wish it had a liner.",4,77
NiCE  that\s all i hear when i swear it.. omg this thing looks great,4,68
Hearts only on 1 side.  Otherwise perfect!  Sturdy and long enough for crossbody.  Nice hardware.,4,97
"Have tried these earrings on but have not worn them all day.  They appear to be comfortable without pinching.  I like the ""comfort clip"" design.",4,144
I liked the set got a lot of complements,4,40
Super nice quality. Exceeded expectations ! Goo buy for the price. Seems to be holding up well. Five stars if it had access hole to slide out Driving license(have to dig it out).,4,178
love this,4,9
"Ring is beautiful, but from the side, you can tell the center stone is a bit loose and crooked. For the price it's absolutely beautiful though. Shipped pretty quickly.",4,167
My husband often has wet leather boots from snow or rain.  He uses the boot stretchers for those instances and his boots stay right sized without that uncomfortable shrinking that usually occurs when leather gets wet.  He's happy with this boot stretchers.,4,256
Fabric is soft and I went up one size<br />M to L fit is great,4,62
Order a small and it comes just past my knees. Wish it was a little shorter but if your tall it will be perfect,4,111
While this is indeed beautiful and I love it.. My only problem with it is that it falls open a lot. The small latch never wants to stay closed. Other than that I love it.,4,170
A little difficult to put in but otherwise I'm happy with these.,4,64
"First of all, I have received a different dress, same navy color and material. However, I have decided to keep it.<br />The size seem true. Fits good. However, if you have a great bust, it is not the best model for you. Unless, you will cover the top with a scarf or massive jewelry.",4,283
Runs big. I had gotten the small and fits like a medium/large. If they had an X-small would fit better. It’s a loose fit not a curve fitting t-shirt.,4,149
"A little bit smaller than I thought, but still super cute.",4,58
I really love these blue crystal earrings. the only thing that could make them better is a stronger latch. I have to make sure they are not going to fall out. I don't want to lose them.,4,185
Good riding glasses for the money. Only complaint is they let a little too much air come in around your eyes but I got used to it.,4,130
Recommend buying 1 size up since it did shrink in the wash.  It's a cute top.,4,77
"It looks good, but feels a little light. Colors are a little darker than in the picture, but overall makes a good gift. 4 stars only for the $.  I think it's a little too much..",4,177
"This is a cute hat, the red is a bit darker than the pic, but I really like it.  I've received compliments on this hat.  The sizing strap in the back could work better, but otherwise a great purchase.",4,200
Comfotable,4,10
It's really pretty and delicate. I'm scared to put it on 😅 my fault by reacting to only the photo. So good job on marketing lol. My man is Omega psi phi and I want to have some accessory that complement him during events.,4,221
Good quality of the material and very polite seller.<br />I bought an XXL trying to use as a short dress but this is not as long as it appears on the pic.,4,154
Have an older Tilly's Tec Wool Hat that wrinkled pretty bad. Steamed it with starch but only held up for a couple of days. Used this product and it held shape much longer than the starch. So I gave it multiple coats with a little steam and now it holds shape even longer. Happy with purchase.,4,292
I like it. But not easy to put on with it's clasp. Lessen learned.,4,66
"I would have actually given this the 5-star rating, except I ended up paying more for the postage than for the keychain (My Bad!!!)<br /><br />JUST A NOTE: Also, it (Marilyn figure) is about 3-inches high. I don't think this was said on the web page, so I wasn't exactly sure how big is was.",4,291
"Good sweater, no problems. But not relaxed fit unless you get next size up. Warm.",4,81
"Charles Verschuuren is my grandfather. There are many other art pieces available: paintings, posters and drawings.",4,114
"Fit perfect and I really like the length of the shirt, I'll probably buy another one.",4,85
"came from quite a distance, so I understand why it took a couple weeks. But I receive them today, & I am so excited! They look amazing! All the colors are very accurate, and the silicon a strong and durable. Thank you so much for the product.",4,242
"These necklaces are as described, however, I’m quite short.  I should have realized this, but they were much too long.  Fortunately, they arrived just before our Church fundraiser and made a nice addition to the silent auction!",4,227
"If I order a large as a set i want all pieces to be LARGE. Companies keep sending these lil @$$ bras. I had to pull it to the middle to cover my nip nip. If I open the jacket, the other half hanging out. BUT I WOULD ORDER AGAIN.",4,228
"I have a very tiny wrist, wish I could adjust the ring size and bracelet size",4,77
Received on time and in perfect condition.  Suggest buy according to true shoe size.  Elastic holds shoe cover in place over shoes but a bit loosly.  Goes best with hippie outfit.  Also would go well with Indian outfit for older female.,4,236
"Beautiful dress and I like how the Coolibar dresses are cut and fit. However, this style fit slightly smaller than other Coolibar dresses.",4,138
"The locket is cute, but the clasp to hold it to the chain is poorly constructed making it easy to detach and the locket is nearly impossible for the average fingernail to open.",4,176
Top of socks need a little stretch in them. But other wise ok. Don't put these socks in the dryer.,4,98
Cute! Looks like picture but they run narrow around the calf muscles. If you have big calf muscle I wouldn't buy.,4,113
This suit is great over all. The bottoms fit good. The pads in the top aren’t so great. And there is no writing on the back. Besides that it is really good!,4,156
I've seen a definite reduction in eye strain when working on the computer!,4,74
"needs more support in the ankle, it slips",4,41
"The rings are nice but they're too thick for ladies fingers. My opinion<br />But I like them , color are nice and bright",4,120
Great dress for the price! Maybe order a size smaller than you think tho,4,72
I really liked these but they could be a bit more breathable and soft. That's what separates them from a higher priced garment like UA.,4,135
Just what I was wanting. Studs earrings that I can sleep wearing.,4,65
"They are very pretty, but just kind of tight across the toes.",4,61
"The overall appearance, looked good, fit as expected",4,52
"So, so cute. I like the thickness. Minus one because they make my feet sweat.",4,77
Studs work well for second hole. Quality seems good so far. Earrings are more ball shaped than the images on the site. Overall a good buy.,4,138
This dress is BEAUTIFUL but no give. If you have boobs size up. I’m a 36D and had to get a large for the girls. But now the waist is too big. 👎🏽,4,144
"The star pendant looks really nice, and I love the size of it! It is not as small as other stars that sold on Amazon, and it's sparkling~<br />so for the price, it's great! However, the chain that comes with it, looks horrible~",4,227
"Arms could be longer, but fits well. Ordered a size up. Very warm.",4,66
I bought these for my 11-year-old niece because she wanted knee high boots.  She is tall for her age.  They are perfect and she loves them.,4,139
Pretty design but the cups were too big for me. I need a large size but small bust. Nothing fits me. The quality was much better than the no-brand-name.,4,152
Soft material  and cute style. Flowy and light weight. The way the shirt drapes in the back is a little..different but I'll probably keep the shirt. It'll probably grow on me.,4,175
Dress zip keeps sticking when pulling up have to change zipper. Overall nice dress a bit tight should of ordered a size up.,4,123
It has pockets! It fits true to size. Is comfy. Color is as expected. It’s all good. I dig it.,4,94
Just what I've been looking for to wear with leggings.  Have gotten lots of compliments on the outfit.,4,102
material nice. Not as oversized as I thgouht it would be. Nearer to a reg fit.,4,78
"Super cute, but the material is a little thin",4,45
I love the socks. But 1 of the socks I got had a small hole on the top of the foot. Not a big deal now but I’m sure it will grow.,4,129
"Not much to say, simple and expressive, could have been a bit larger, but overall I'm satisfied.",4,96
These earrings were slightly bigger than I thought. I have both my first and second hole pierced and it’s hard to find earrings for my second hole that don’t collide with these while they are in my first hole.,4,209
I am a medium do I bought the XL size which git oerfectly. Can't wait to wear it.,4,81
Sandals work much better than I thought Great relief for my neuropathy I highly recommend them,4,94
wish there weren't quite as many labrets but other than that i love it,4,70
"this is a silky coverup very pretty, only complaint is the sides are not sewn down. There is just a little stitch on each side.",4,127
"I really like these panties. They're comfortable and don't ride up anywhere. Cotton is usually best for panties ('breathable'), but I haven't had any issues in relation to that, so I would recommend these.",4,205
Love the earrings but they're a little delicate. The clasp bends easily.,4,72
"My bad. I didn't know how small 4mm was. Good for baby ears, but would go through my big holes. Will buy the 10mm.  I think those will be large enough.",4,151
"The material is great quality is good. The only reason I took a star is the 6in inseam, I prefer the 9in but can not find them any more in charged cotton. These ride up my leg.",4,176
Están muy bonitos me gustaron mucho,4,35
This is the style I had been searching for.  It is thin and yet it holds what I need.  NOT easy to find in any stores.  I found similar wallets but it was usually over $100's.  The only wish would be to have a zipper pocket on the outside for coins.  Very happy I finally found what I wanted.,4,292
Great sunglasses ! Got it for my boyfriend for Valentines !!!<br />Comes in a really nice solid case. Would recommend to any guy !,4,130
I love it I just came in really small packaging and I almost threw it out when I didn’t find it in the box,4,106
"The built in shorts are quite short, I would have liked them longer. It would make a great swim skirt",4,101
This is suitable for small to medium sized eye-glass frames.<br />Extra large frames won't fit inside.<br />It's a tight fit. I wish this were longer.,4,150
Beautiful purse! Fairly roomy but don't plan on putting a lot of things in there. I didn't notice any lingering smell as others noted. There isn't much give in the purse...it is very sturdy!!,4,191
"These are great gaiters, I own severa of them and they’re my “go-to” mask when venturing out into the world.",4,108
The glasses are very cute and come with a car case.  My grandson loves them!,4,76
The idea is great ..just needs.more of a v shape not so wide would help make this a fabulous product...shows in high heels.,4,123
"Looked really cute on, and even though I ordered a size up, this baby runs small.",4,81
"could be the best shoe , but too narrow. had to return.",4,55
The clip at the end of the band broke. It was a nice watch until it broke.,4,74
These are great. They’re a little too big but she can grow into them.,4,69
"Purchased two mediums for my teenage daughters! They like the jacket but it runs short. If you want it to look like the model's order at least two sizes bigger than what you would normally wear. Cute jacket though, just wished I would have known to order two sizes up.",4,268
nice nice comfortable for top half,4,34
I could have gone for a smaller size.....,4,41
Very nice looking hat! lots of compliments.,4,43
This is so flexible to wear. Lounge around the house or wear out in public.,4,75
The pockets hit you at a weird spot & make you look a little hippier than you might be. Nice fit otherwise though & super comfy.,4,128
I like the shirt and it’s color. The smell of it was so bad I had to wash it twice!,4,83
Not quite as &#34;green&#34; as the picture but comfortable and nice,4,68
"Light weight and comfortable. Do run large. The pants run long. I don't mind because their pajamas. I would buy these again, great price.",4,137
My daughter loved it. I thought it could have had a little more taste.,4,70
Both the dress and the crinoline were what we expected. We were pleased with both items,4,87
I love the fabric and it fits quite nicely,4,42
Just what I wanted. Short enough to not be seen with certain loafers.,4,69
These are cool and the kids loved them. Only thing that could have been better was the rubber bands that keep them on their fingers easily come off. They can be put back on but it's a hassle that shouldn't have to be dealt with.,4,228
"This was a bit larger than expected for my daughter, but she really loves the suit.",4,83
"I liked these earrings, but they are tiny.  Although the dimensions are listed, they seem very small on adult ears, mine at least.  They would not have shown up.  They are beautiful, though.",4,190
Happy. Perfect size and wanted an outside pocket for phone.,4,59
"I ordered a large, expecting a slightly tight pick for a workout shirt, but it was actually too big on me. But, it is a great moisture wicking shirt.",4,149
Kind of flimsy. Two of them were broken when they came. I think only children would be able to use these which is why we got them.,4,130
They are soft and fits correctly,4,32
"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the color.  I have a black bracelet and I love it.  Ordered this color, in the color choice it said rose red.  Thought it would be more red.",4,201
Nice for a costume.  You may need to wear a vest or belt if you are not thin through the stomach area.,4,102
"This is a beautiful corset but it is WAY small!  I wear an XL, it looks like a medium. A friend of mine loves this corset so she may buy it.  If not, I'll have to return it.  It arrived much sooner than expected so I was very pleased with that.",4,244
"Good quality belt but recently I’ve developed a problem with withdrawing the prong from the hole, so I need to get this fixed or replace it.",4,140
"No complaints, it is pretty much what it looks like. Looks nice when worn too. The only thing is, that it is a lot shinier than it looks in the picture. It seriously glitters a LOT and I would have preferred something exactly like the picture. But I am happy.",4,259
"Loooove the way these look on!  They fit beautifully.  They are long on me, but I am 5’4 and have short legs.  I am very curvy in the thighs and butt and these guys looks amazing on!  Only complain is they are “wipe clean” only.",4,228
Cute boots for the price!,4,25
"The fabric is good, but the size is a little bit big on my face. Unfortunately, the seller doesn't have any smaller sizes.",4,122
"Order was perfect for my outside shade. It took a very long time to receive the order, more than 3 weeks?",4,105
"The material was very soft and comfy, but the waist part was kinda tight. I'm a solid medium in pajama pants and this was kind of small around my waist.",4,152
"El color Burgundy  no es realmente vino, sino más bien, un rojo oscuro. Lamentablemente  tuve que devolverlo ya que no combinaba  con el vestido que iba a utilizar. Por lo demás  es muy bonito y de buena  calidad.",4,213
"These are US sizes...no need to upsize. Roomier than expected but has a lovely drape. Not a dressy top, but nicer with jeans than a plain t shirt. The sleeves are long, which I love having long arms myself. Item washed well and kept its shape.",4,243
"I actually bought these to go with a costume. They are decent quality but they certainly aren't anything fancy, not surprising for this price though.  The clip part works well. Both fit fairly tightly, though the one clip is a bit more loose than the other.",4,257
The waist is too large. The pants slip down. I'm 5'9 140 lbs and quite fit. I ordered a medium. They are good for yoga but not for running.,4,139
Love it. A bit snug.,4,20
These cufflinks are better looking than the picture,4,51
These are great for the pilates studio and my slippery wood floors at home. They can slip off of I wear them in boots due to the soft roll tops but I still like the ones I have.,4,177
This ring is a lot prettier than the photo shows. I gave it to my daughter as a surprise for everything she does. She loved it!,4,127
Expensive compared to the quality,4,33
Love Love Love this bag !!! Easy comfortable to carry . Bought 3 & so did my friends!!,4,86
I got these for my son because he is solid but they were too big for him. Still nice jeans though,4,97
I really like this top. I paired it with a cute skirt and I've also worn it with jeans. I usually wear XL in tops and this top fit comfortably. I will purchase other colors.,4,173
I like the material very much.  A little big but can have that fixed.  Am very happy with this jumpsuit.,4,104
Dropped them & lens popped out.  Contacted vendor & they sent me another pair free!,4,83
Straps in back had to be altered to stay on.,4,44
Cute shoes but run tight and at least 1 size (possibly more but they didn’t have any bigger sizes) too small.,4,109
The chain itself is a little dull but for $6 I really shouldn't complain.,4,73
"These are a skin-tight fit until the legs. If you want a slightly looser fit, go up a size. When I took them out of the package, I thought there was no way I would fit, but they do stretch. I thought I had ordered a child size, but I can wear them.",4,248
"Overall this cosplay is quite good! The fabric of the bodysuit, gloves and belt are great quality. The boot covers aren't great and the bodysuit is a bit baggy in some areas, plus the ribbon on the tail comes off super easily, but other than that it's a good cosplay!",4,267
"A little small for my car key, but i made it work",4,49
"super cute! fits well, good length. I'm 5'2 and its perfect",4,59
Fits big and I even ordered a year under 😔 will be washing and hoping it shrinks but overall beautiful my daughter loves it.,4,124
Fit was fine. Color is too drab.,4,32
This hat arrived quickly. It fits great and looks great. I'm so glad I took a chance and got it. Great price too.,4,113
Totally cite just wish it was slightly bigger,4,45
Great sunglasses. Blocks off the sun well. Has a more plastic feel but that’s probably due to such a low price. Nose buds fell right off after first wear even after multiple coats of glue to keep it in tact.,4,207
it is nowhere near as long as it looks in the pictures but it's still cute and still wearable.,4,94
It is so cute! Wish it fit my body however I wasn’t able to zip it up. The chest area was too small. Bought a small and my shoulder and chest didn’t fit. Had to return.,4,168
Very well made good quality. But it’s just a dress not a bathing suit,4,69
Runs a half size big.,4,21
"They are not TOO heavy,<br />but they have more weight to them<br />than some of my other earrings.  The gold<br />trim looks nice and I think they appear to be more<br />expensive than they are.",4,195
"Fit and color were just right, really like the &#34;cold shoulser&#34; effect.",4,78
Love these leggings as always!,4,30
"This a very soft pretty yoga work out type top. I am by no means big (36B- 29 waist-38 Hips middle age body)but the first time I ordered a large and it was super super tight, I re-ordered a xxl and it fits just right ( I like my tops with breathing room)",4,254
Love the look of these  slippers. Unfortunately they were a little hard to walk in for my seven-year-old… The little green part of the pineapple kept rubbing into his food. Unfortunately had to return 😕,4,202
Beautiful Trendy but quite Heavy,4,32
"While I marked this sweatshirt as true to size, it really wasn’t. It ran short and wide in the body, not enough to return it, though. Absolutely loved the Tinkerbell design.",4,173
Got this for my teenage daughter and she loves it! It didn't come in a box like they said it would so I was a little upset with that!,4,133
very pretty night gown. Just wish it were a little bigger. If it was it would be perfect . But I do like it.,4,108
The nose pinches tight and I have a narrow bridge.  I can't imagine someone with a big schnoz wearing this thing!  Quality was good though so I only knocked off one star.,4,170
Not as loose as I expected,4,26
I expected the &#34;fire mom&#34; words to be a bit more noticeable. Other than that I love it!,4,95
"Material is cheap & stretchy, too much cheap polyester & not enough Cotton- quality is just ok. But it’s cute enough to workout in or wear under a jacket.",4,154
"Make sure you look at sizes and length,I love this top it's super cute!! I get compliments on it all the time:)",4,111
"Top I way to big for my 34Bs but the bottoms are perfect for my size 8 bum. A bit tight when pulling it on, but that's to be expected with this style.",4,150
"Good clarity, low internal reflection. Tint is not nearly as dark as factory lenses though; in open water or on snow you may still feel some minor discomfort from reflected sunlight. Price is right, though.",4,206
Very cute! Nice lavender color 💜,4,32
A little too fitted for my crunchers but works great. Happy with it will work this season. Maybe buy a size up if your baby is on the chunckier side.,4,149
"Perfect modest swimsuit.  I'm 5'4"" and 150 lbs and Large fit great.  The suit has a relaxed top that hides the tummy perfectly.  The bottoms are unlined, but the pattern hides everything.  The top also has pads which can be removed.",4,232
Very beautiful set!,4,19
These rings seem to be good quality so far though they were smaller than I expected.,4,84
"Bought it as a gift, she loves it thus far.",4,43
Good quality. I don't think it's officially licensed (no ubisoft markings) but its still great. if you're looking for the hat and mask this is it. I did have to take in the mask a bit (maybe I have a small head) but other then that it's great!,4,243
I've used this bomber jacket for a while and like it. It looks good and fits well. The only bad thing I've noticed is that some of the stitching has come undone after a little bit of use and I see little strings of cotton every now and then.,4,241
"The pants are excellent, except for one major flaw:  The buttons rare held on by only one or two loops of fragile thread.  Every button fell off the firrst time I wore them.  Once I properly properly attached them I am happy.  I bought two other pairs in other colors, with the same result.",4,290
Excellent for the shooting range. A great bargain.,4,50
"This was given as a gift and the recipient loved it! It's very pretty, lightweight and airy.",4,92
"The dresses  are nice, but look better on line. The material is a different color ( more faded). I will keep for because is was good price.",4,139
They look ok but they're too tight and inflexible,4,49
It’s a nice jacket but it runs small.,4,37
"Perfect for a high school graduation - looks great, and is every bit as good as the one from Josten's, at a much cheaper price!",4,127
This product is alittle large but cute,4,38
"Fits good, easy to install.  It is however a little narrow than the apple watch bands.  We'll see how it holds up",4,113
This dress is almost perfect - just a bit too long.  I bought a small and am 5 foot 6 inches and I have to wear heels in order for it not to drag on the ground. Very soft and the rest fits beautifully though.,4,208
"I love the material, and it fits well. It's longer than I had anticipated, but would probably be fine for an office environment.",4,128
These are cute. I wish they would be been more snug. Still a great top.,4,71
Fits great and really helped where I'm at with all this snow. And time to put them away till next year :},4,105
clothes were creased. But fit as expected. Color is lovely.,4,59
"The shorts are very lightweight and feel not the greatest of quality. It has a built-in soft lining that feels okay on the skin, but not sure how durable the material would be in the long term. The zipper pockets are a great bonus on the shorts as I don't have to worry about anything falling out.",4,297
"Super cute, I'm a server so i just wear black slacks and this works perfectly",4,77
Well made and looks good,4,24
Love the softness and very comfortable.. wish the they were just a little thicker!!,4,83
Fits good and comfortable as advertised,4,39
they are super comfy and not see through which is the best part! I do wish the legs were longer (I'm 5'5). The waist band may be tight for some because it is a thick type of band.,4,179
Soft and cozy material;) Rich color;) It flares out like a maternity top so i suggest ordering a size down and it will be perfect size;),4,136
Very durable. Cute tutu. Weird fitting around the shoulders. But good enough for a toddler ballet class.,4,104
"I don't really like the material these are made of, but they fit so well.  I love the high waist and hugs in all the right places. I ordered the solid black ones and they are not made the same as the ones with the stripe.  Disappointed",4,235
Love the way these feel. A tad bit small but I'm sure they will stretch a little after I've worn them a few times.,4,114
"Love it, so cute. Material is a little thin so I'm afraid to wash it lol.",4,73
"Great fit, super soft, lightweight and comfortable.",4,51
I bought this for my 13 year old and it was too tight so my 11 year old lucked out. The colors are nice and bright and there is a pocket for a filter. I guess I have to admit that my teenager is no longer a kid.,4,211
Very cute fits great,4,20
This is still a little big in length and width for my glasses. The depth is good. I was looking for something that would be the right size so I could carry them easily in my small purse. The quality however is excellent.,4,220
"Very darling. Looked so precious on, but it was a little small. I would recommend ordering the next size up .",4,109
Flexibility & sturdiness are matched well in that it goes on easily  yet stays put.<br />Doesn't discolor with regular wearing. Weight feels nice.<br />Occasionally gets caught in long hair,4,189
"Ok cloth, you just can't use it on 24kt gold, per the instructions..I have found that most of these cloths do better after a sort of break in period..",4,150
Got this for my daughter and she loves it.,4,42
"It was too big for my son, but was a very sturdy fabric and seemed to be well made.",4,83
A little light weight and flimsy. Even for Kids. Comes with great case though.,4,78
Its Perfect!,4,12
Cute dress wore to a wedding. A little short but nice material and elegant.,4,75
Great. Wish it had a bra in it. Fits great.,4,43
They're pretty comfortable. Fit my legs and my waist nicely but my butt was squeezed. I would recommend getting a size up and just taking in the waistband. Would have gone three stars but the pockets were actually a pretty good size and that's a real plus for me.,4,263
Does the job... 3rd pair we have purchased,4,42
"Order 2 sizes up. I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large to be safe and really needed an XL. However, it was still very well made and I just had to suck in my gut to wear it.",4,181
Very cute outfit,4,16
What a bargain!  The dress fit my 14 year old grand daughter perfectly.  The fabric was a nice weight (not flimsy) and true to size.,4,132
Dress requires a slip underneath as you can see your bra. It’s a little short but it was perfect with a flannel tied around my waist while out shopping. Very comfortable.,4,170
Very comfortable and sporty looking<br />Makes walking great again,4,66
This is a very nice shirt/dress. I bought it to wear over leggings. It is exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased with my purchase. It is actually nicer than I thought it would be. Good deal too!,4,199
"Tho it's very beautiful,& sturdy, Its quite a large bangle in circumference, for the average small wristed woman, i requested a smaller made one, but got no reply.😔",4,164
Looks just like advertised. A little on the thin side but has lasted through the summer.,4,88
"These socks were a great Christmas present for any pig lover! They were a little thinner than I thought they might be, but they fit and have cute pigs on them, and their breeds on the bottom.",4,191
good costume,4,12
Loved it<br />Will buy again in a different color,4,49
Its a lil smaller then i like but looks ok. Thank u,4,51
It's a gift of course. I think my daughter will love. Lots of compartments to keep you organized.,4,97
"Great buy for the price. So far, I’ve only worn the few that I initially liked and often get compliments.",4,105
This belt is easy and fun. I bought the black on black. My only complaint is that the black buckle easily chips. This allows the metal you shine through making it look old. Perhaps another color would hold up longer... I'm sure it would.,4,237
"Good quality dress, fit as expected. I returned it because the color is somewhat too matte for me. It doesn't have the vibrant purple as shown in the picture.",4,158
I liked the design of the hoodie; however the material was a little thin and smelled kind of weird when it came in. It also took really long to ship the item. It runs kinda small as well I would get a size up especially if you’re like me and you like your hoodies a little more loose.,4,284
"A bit too shiny metal, but I liked that the necklace is adjustable.",4,67
Will not last,4,13
"So far so good.  A bit tight fitting it onto the frame and I managed  to pop a couple of  stitches in doing that; probably my fault but it does mean that there is no real slack. Otherwise, it seems to be well made and the price was right.  It seems to be a good deal.",4,267
Wife likes.,4,11
Toms fit snuggly. They may seem &#34;tight&#34; when you first put them on but they are true to size and sort of strecth out / mold to your feet after a few wears.<br /><br />Love this particular design. Cool but goes with everything.<br />I wish it had a black sole but whatcha gonna do???!!,4,292
Quality is not the best but for the price I paid it works fine :),4,65
Super cute and comfy but very see-through.  I wear it for PJ’s mostly or if I wear it out I definitely need a slip.,4,115
looks just as pictured. is well made. fits true to size.,4,56
Great keychain. Worth it.,4,25
I needed XL - came more like a medium/large. Gave to my 15 year old daughter.,4,77
The shirt fits good and is true to size. It is shorter than I thought it would be.,4,82
"bigger than expected, few pockets inside.  good quality",4,55
Fit and feels good.,4,19
it work fine,4,12
"The color is lovely, reversable, and a nice weight year round.<br />Very pleased",4,80
I love this shirt but order up a size if you are between sizes. It runs tight at the hips,4,89
"I was disappointed in the size, but other than that they are ok",4,63
I used it as gift the material is soft and nice pattern,4,55
"These are the embroidered patches worn by soldiers on their old berets.  We use them for our military science cadets, attached with hot glue to their uniform issue ballcaps for a small high school detachment.  The kids love them, they look sharp, and provide a great background for the student rank.",4,299
I love these pants! They are so soft and warm and comfortable. The bad thing is the cost. You can get them at Walmart for 1/3 of the price.,4,139
"cute shoe..simple, I like them",4,30
"Very cute top, but runs very small. I am 5'7"", 130 lbs. and got a size large. Should have purchased an XL.",4,106
"Great bag. Smells like chemicals when it arrives and needs a week to air out. Probably because it's not made from any real materials. Other than that, it's a great bag that holds a lot.",4,185
"Awesome dress though does fit funny in the arm holes, a bit of a sewing mishap I fixed myself.",4,94
"I love them , beautiful color, will order another pair.",4,55
"Loved this dress, the arms where s little tight and the sequence scratched my under arm but other then that the dress was perfect for what I used it for!!!",4,155
Cant wait to start wearing it,4,29
"I like this shirt, but I’m tall and this shirt just barely fits me in the length.",4,81
These are nice ..however over time the designs wear off..I like them but not sure I’d order them again ..,4,105
"Wish it had a button or fastener to hold it besides the cloth belt! I added safety pins to keep it together. Breat material, quality, and color.",4,144
"Super, super cute! Unfortunately it’s a little bit in the chest area for me and seems to run a little large. I got a small which is usually the size I wear but HAVE to wear something under it at all times. Other than that super cute and exactly as pictured!",4,257
This is perfect for my nephews Fiancé and she loved it,4,54
I just bought a spinning but but seat is so hard it was painful to ride it.. I wear the padded shorts and bought a padded seat and I can spin for 40 minutes without too much discomfort!! So glad I bought them,4,208
"I like the gold hardware on the ends of the bane makes it look high quality, the color is not as uniform as the picture shows. It is attractive but I had to return, it did not fit my Garmin vivomove watch.",4,205
"a little too big, but good quality.",4,35
Safe distance dancing.,4,22
Very nice look. Order a size up!,4,32
Great boho vibe!,4,16
just like in the picture,4,24
too fitted for my tastes.<br />gave it to a friend.,4,51
I liked them a lot just a bit wide around the ankle.,4,52
"Very warm.  Runs small, I wear xl pants bought a 2xl and can't snap the top.  Tight on hips and thighs.",4,103
"fabric is nicer than anticipated, and after initial handwashing & airdry, it is hanging quite njicely and should assist my old-lady, old-fashioned fall wardrobe. So far it seems like good value for the money.",4,208
Nicest made and thin enough to accommodate a small pendant bale. Structured to keep its shape yet soft and pliable.,4,115
just the right size.  even my droid ultra fits inside with money and cards.,4,75
Very cute.  Bra area fits a little big.,4,39
"Great slim case for iPhone 7. The only reason that I did not give it a 5-star rating is because I would wanted the case to have more GRIP and possibly other colors. Other than that, it is a very nice case.",4,205
Stud is not located in the middle of this earring,4,49
It's very charming and nice:),4,29
It's a great dress just runs a little small,4,43
Loved the concept and showed them to all my friends. Easy to wear. A great idea,4,79
I use it to tie up my natural hair. I almost bought a natural hair tie for 10 for one. Then I read about how the tie was made of satin and decided to buy this instead. By the way got two hair ties much very cheap.,4,213
"Really small fitting, I’m a size nz10/us6 and 5’8 tall they fit but only just. They would probably fit better if I wasn’t as tall",4,129
"The shirt itself is very look. I think it would look cute with a blazer or cardigan, but it's very long. I am short (5'0 ft) and short waisted. This nearly covers my butt. It's a tad bigger than I thought it would be. Check the size chart.",4,239
They are look much better than what i expected,4,46
Great for polishing the silver items in the house.,4,50
"These are the warmest gloves I've ever owned. They have two layers, which really helps. I have very small hands and they fit well. The only problem I've had is the Velcro that holds the mitt flap back when using your fingers came off. It was an easy fix though. I just sewed it back on.",4,286
"This is a nice dress shirt, made from what feels like solid, heavy-weight oxford cloth, which means it should hold up nicely to heavy starch and repeated visits to the cleaners.",4,177
"Very cute and perfect for spring. The color is exactly how it appears on the picture. The shirt is VERY long though and the fabric almost feels like a shower curtain. Despite the fabric and length, I got plenty of compliments on this shirt!",4,240
It's cool....makes it easier to remove pins,4,43
Liked the most was the quality and weight of the piece coupled with the design.  No dislikes.  My wife however had bought me a piece and of course her gift would take first place.,4,179
"I like that it was easy to attach to my watch.  It looks and feels just fine.  Not to big, not to small.  I didn't like how long it took to get to me for such a small item.",4,172
"All good, I usually wear size medium but ordered this in a large since they tend to run small, the arms just more tight than snug.",4,130
This is very pretty and I enjoy wearing it.,4,43
Really cute booties!  They feel about 1/2 size too large all around but thick socks will take of the extra space.  Well worth the money.,4,136
Very pretty piece but haven't worn it yet. Praying It hold up,4,61
"More casual than it looks like in the picture. It's comfortable and nice material not see through at all! Nice size pockets that aren't obvious. Nice adjustable straps. 5' 9"" 165 lbs I got this in large it fits perfectly.",4,221
"I liked the print, but it is very thin in comparison to other mouse pads I have purchased.",4,90
Nice material. Haven't gotten a chance to wear and can't wait,4,61
"I love the color, size, material, design and quality. I am not sure why there is a center hook and extra strap inside the bag. It gets in the way and is not useful.",4,164
Super comfortable to wear.  My son is 20 months old.  He will only wear sweats like clothes.  I like it a lot.,4,110
Cheap enough buff. I figured it was pretty cool and I could turn inside out if I didn't like the skull look. One star less because the inside isn't black like it looks in the pic. So....not reversible like I was hoping.,4,219
Pretty summer dress. Drapes nicely. Will go down a size.,4,56
Fits true to size. It looks better in the picture than it looks on me.,4,70
"Pretty warm, but material feels pretty cheap. Cute looking, but the button already fell off. It hasn’t even been two months.",4,124
"So happy with this topper. It did come with dark spots on the lower right side, front. However,  with a cleaning cloth and some blotting followed by a rinse with water, all good! 😉",4,180
I really liked this. It is a little big on the bottom but if you have large boobs you might want to go ahead and stay with your regular size or the girls will be popping out the sides.  It is very cute though. It is for a vacation in Barbados so I think it will be perfect for dinner.,4,284
I'm very happy with this product.  Most local stores do not carry 3.00 and I'm glad to have different colors.,4,109
Really like the watch.,4,22
"About the middle ground, better than cheaper  stuff from Volde★Mart but not quite as good as Carhartt. Go a size higher.",4,120
I haven't used it yet but I love it! The color is vibrant and the velvet feels so soft. It comes with a detachable silver chain strap and can be worn on the shoulder as well as a clutch.I can't wait to flaunt it.,4,212
"I had bought these same shorts in other colors to wear around the house. I expected them to be a little see through, which they are but I don't mind. They're soft and comfortable. My only issue is these yellow ones are smaller than the other colors, just a little tighter in the waistband.",4,289
You get what you pay for 4 stars because you can’t expect much from a cheaper grill I'd say this is great for a hollowed costume or something small but don’t flex this grill it won’t work lol.,4,192
"for the price, fit is nice. the brown tinted ones are great for evening or deep woods, brightens the light. other 2 work great for day riding or bright sunlight. Helps with the dust but doesn't completely fit tight against the face.",4,232
"Color is a nice shade of dark beige.  Quality is good for the price; b/c the material and stitching has stretch, the hems are a bit gathered after first wash.",4,158
Looks exactly as pictured! Beautiful purse. Only thing I don’t like is that it doesn’t open wide.,4,97
"The tank top and headband fit great, short are HUGE! They slide right off my daughter. Oh well, the tank top is cute",4,116
"Was a bit larger than I thought it would it be, but I still love it!  Glad I purchased it.",4,90
"It's almost like the were smashed,  some parts of shoe never went was to original shape. It's ok tho,  ordered just for around the house shoes",4,142
The scarf is very long,4,22
Was satisfied with item.,4,24
I like that the dress can be casual and special occasion.,4,57
"wasn't expecting much, but turned out to be really cool and i was surprised at the first glance in fact",4,103
"Fits well, the “fur” inside is super soft and cozy. This coat didn’t keep me as warm in a brisk wind as I thought it would, but it definitely has some bulk to it. Love the look of the coat, but the “inside” sleeves are extra long making the use of your arms a little cumbersome.",4,278
Very pretty charm bracelet but the clasp is hard to open and is not functional,4,78
Good for indoor music but not good when there is outside noise. Especially when you are walking where there is constant traffic. It is almost like a mini speaker near your ears. Everybody in the room can hear what you are listening to.,4,235
"Super soft. Great quality. I’m 5’4”, 160lbs. Initially bought medium. Had to return and get a small.",4,100
Cute and fun. I got these for some kids that I did a camera club with. They loved them but didn't hold up well to kid use.,4,122
Love This shirt. Wearing it now. So light and comfortable perfect for me to wear on casual fridays to work. (:  casual and professional.,4,136
Its very pretty & colorful. Its a lot smaller then what I thought & not cotton. Would make a great gift bag for a birthday party or a over night bag. Great for younger kids.,4,173
The size was perfect and made of durable material.,4,50
"When I first put these pants on, they were a bit tight .As I wore them throughout the day, they loosened and are super comfy.",4,125
Dress is more yellow than it appears on the my screen (not a good color on me). The shoulders are more narrow than other dresses of this style. If I'm in a dress I have to be comfortable so it goes back.,4,203
It’s a cute shirt and great colors,4,34
Comfortable but does run a little large.,4,40
This jumpsuit was super cute. My only complaint was the beck part should be more streachy. I kept having to pull at my neck because it was tight. Also was able to use my vibrant makeup on my face to go w costume.,4,212
ZIPPER IS HARD TO PULL UP!!,4,27
It’s super comfortable to wear these. They lost one of those metal end caps from the draw string before the first wash. Just from tying them or untying them. Otherwise I’m very pleased so far.,4,192
very soft bag; lots of room... almost too much room.. lol; I pack it til it's too heavy for me!  Has lots of pockets and zipper compartments; nice color blue; goes with pretty much anything,4,189
They looked great but had to keep them a little low cause they couldn’t cover my butt properly otherwise  😂,4,107
"The piece was pretty, however, the necklace was knotted and tangled so bad it took an act of Congress to undo it and now it looks awful.  You can tell where it was messed up.  :(  I now have to get another necklace in order to wear this piece.  I think the seller should replace it with a new one!!!",4,299
The shoe I received is not the one in the picture but it fits.,4,62
Quality is great Material in light and dress overall is comfortable. Only complaint is the seam of the dress is in the front down the middle and the polka dots are to large making the seam very noticeable. The seam should be in the back.,4,237
They’re really pretty and work ok.<br />Good price for a 2pack I think.,4,71
Its super soft yet light weight and pretty in person,4,52
the crotch gusset is a little weird. But every other aspect of the pants is badass. Def going to order another pair,4,115
"I have not wore them yet, but I tried them on, I like it, can't wait for weather to get warmer to wear it!",4,106
She loved the color. Wanted a little more padding.,4,50
I WILL GIVE IT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR HER B-DAY IN AUGUST.,4,59
Pretty damn nice. Wish the band was a little longer. But I've really large manly wrist so it's all good. Lol,4,108
Fit well. Rubbed a little bit on the top of my foot,4,51
Thank you my girls like the top n bottom outfit,4,47
Very pretty as and comfy,4,24
The quality is so-so but it's a very pretty dress!,4,50
"Very pretty.  The material feels nice and the skirt has the perfect flow to it.  My daughter wants it in blue now, too!",4,119
The sizes of both ran at least a size smaller. Luckily I have 2 granddaughters that could trade down with each other. They love the feel of the fabric.,4,151
"Nice, high quality sunglasses. I did find they were a little big for my face, so I think I need a 53mm size.  Ended up returning only because of the size.",4,154
Good product just a little flimsy or would have given five stars,4,64
Love this dress but the seam was sewn incorrectly. Not noticeable to others but does cause a pucker where the zipper is.,4,120
It is a solid and durable bag and will work well for what it is being gifted for. The material looks slightly different than in the picture.,4,140
I liked the first one so much that I got one for my wife.,4,57
Inside zipper broke the first time i used it. Need stronger zippers,4,67
The material was a little thinner than expected but soft the fit was true to size. My daughter really likes them,4,112
Use as a workout bag. Roomy and has lots of compartments/pockets. Only issue is with the yoga mat straps....needed to use something to pull them up while not in use to hold a yoga mat.,4,184
Great light sock! I wear a size 7 US men’s shoe fit perfect after a wash. Usually the gender neutral adult character socks fit big these were great now to buy the rest of them! Just wish they were cheaper that is the only reason I don’t give it 5 stars.,4,253
"Love this cardigan, cozy and seems to be made well!<br />Just don’t put it in the dryer mine shrank a little<br />Bit",4,117
Empire waist is too tight.,4,26
Loved the material and the looks.Size was too small and I returned.Would get one size larger than usual,4,103
"Its true to size, the white top isn't see-through which is great since I didn't want to wear a shirt under this. The flowers are not ironed on instead they are just sewed on, which can be bad if you don't wash this inside out.",4,226
Fit both myself and my 10 year old. Nice quality. Daughter says they're itchy (even after washing).,4,99
A little sparklier than expected but nice,4,41
"Very soft, slightly see-through, I used the size chart and purchased a large- but it’s a little big, should have got a medium.",4,126
I would like to have the armor for the jacket please help,4,57
Beautiful and very well made.  A great deal for the money.  I love them because you can wear them with anything and everything.,4,127
"Beautiful and good quality, it's a little bit too big but I can make it work.",4,77
Nice everyone likes but needs to be longer,4,42
"They work great, but greener than I expected.",4,45
Got lots of compliments on these pants but they are cheaply made the seams and hem where not very professional looking and with them being sequins I couldn’t iron them to fix it but overall cute pants I got a small and there was stil a little wiggle room I usually wear a s/m,4,275
Amazing deal and just like described,4,36
It was difficult to see through the eye holes.  Did not move when it was in use but like all rubber masks it got sweaty.,4,120
I wear a 14-16 and purchased a Large. Very comfortable and good for traveling as a bathing suit cover up Or lounger. Length above knee. The hem is not exactly straight across and the pockets do not lay flat. I’m keeping it for the comfort and I like that it’s long sleeved.,4,273
Pretty! I got my exact measurement and they were a little small so I'd say when in doubt go up a size. Look nice and classy.,4,124
These are what I expected with the exception of the metal piece. For my toddler they are a bit large but work well and keep on the mittens well.,4,144
A little lighter shade of turquoise than pictures but they will still look great for my groomsmen,4,97
"This is a great leotard, but runs super small. If it happens to fit your child you won't regret it, but I can't imagine how it would actually fit anyone older than 2. I ordered size S (4-6).",4,190
pretty. a little smaller then expected.,4,39
"Cute and looks like it will hold up for trip. Negative: it is probably going to fall off because the headband is so loose. It’s made with one of those cheap, skinny headbands.",4,175
The wonder woman pajamas look like the type of swimsuits worn in the olden days. They are cute though and you could get socks that go up to their knees with the red and white stripes too. Really cute look for a kid and will keep their feet and body warm.,4,254
sizing runs a little small,4,26
good pants,4,10
Great sweater but sheds some.,4,29
Only had them a few days. Check back to see how the wear.,4,57
Larger than I thought but still great for the kids,4,50
the color is to brigth,4,22
"Amazing quality, great for tummy control, and the booty contour is right where it should be! Highly recommend 👍",4,111
Very cute and edgy design. But if you’ve got fat tiddies be careful. I’d invest in tape and avoid actually swimming in this. Your nipples will be seen if not.,4,158
"These would be AMAZING, if the holes to put your glasses in were bigger. Could not get any pair of glasses I own to fit. Sad because I threw away the packaging before I tested them out, can't return now.",4,203
Definitely a wonderful bag for the price. It is larger than expected. I will be using as a labor & delivery bag.,4,112
Pretty good fit. Comfortable to wear.,4,37
Too tiny i should have read that these were for ears and not tongue..... my fault.,4,82
Thanks so much!,4,15
"I like it - just not enough room. My head is not huge - it fits, but is snug. Hoping it will stretch a bit.",4,107
After back surgery I wasn’t able to been over. I could put these on.,4,68
"Nice leather wallet, but be careful trying to stuff your credit cards in it or you will rip the stitching. Is almost impossible to properly get your checkbook inside it!",4,169
Had no problems with choosing the size. Make sure to refer to the size chart. As described.,4,91
Only dislike is that out of the package strong smell like tires but other than that looks great,4,95
This is a beautiful gown but I am returning it because I like a roomier gown.  It is very clingy but this manufacturer makes others that are more comfortable for sleeping.  I am 5'2&#34; 160lbs and bought a large which was sized ok but too close fitting for my taste,4,266
Good product.  Larger than thought.,4,35
Tthis dress was a really pretty dress. It fits perfectly. Loved the  orange color. I just didn't the collar of the dress on me. I debating whether to return it because it a great dress.,4,185
It was a little smaller than it looked in the pic but is still a pretty fascinator. I needed all white so this was perfect for me. I prefer clips so used the one that came with it and it stayed on beautifully. There's also a headband if you prefer.,4,248
this verry good,4,15
They.re really pretty but turn colors quickly..like 2nd wear it starts fading..they.re gorgeous tho.,4,100
A little big but not bad fore the money and last minute.choicd!,4,63
"If you have a small head, this hat will be a little large...the elastic in the back is not gathered so it does not stretch to fit.  Color and fabric and style, adorable.",4,169
"Love the shirt, but size up. I am glad I did. It runs about a size small.",4,73
"Un poco pequeñas las piedras, pero está bien.",4,45
"I've had this bracelet for a little over a month. Its a cute look and defiantely worth the price. Took a star off because it does not lay flat really but I still like it.<br /><br />EDIT"" broke after 3weeks not recommended",4,222
These slippers are a great color. Nice and soft with a cute fuzzy dinosaur. They run a little small but my son loves them!,4,122
I like it just a little small maybe if i ordered large it will fit me better.,4,77
This dress fits just right and flatters my figure. Every time I wear it I get compliments.,4,90
"It's definitely a lovely T-shirt and very soft, but not anti-odor by any means.  I wore it around the house - nothing strenuous really except for a normal house vacuum routine.  It did not 'stink' (well I did not sweat much that day anyway) but definitely had some mild pit odor.",4,279
"I would like down, but that could be preference. It's a cute top though!",4,72
This dress was super cute! It was a little too large as well as too long.  I’m 5’2 & usually wear a large but I probably could’ve gotten away w/medium.  My biggest issues; it arrived with a stain on the front of it (very subtle) & no tags. I might take my chances and order again in a medium size…,4,297
"I usually expect having to size up with these items, but I wen't way too large and I am a little miffed, but overall the quality is really nice, and the style is adorable. I enjoy it!",4,183
Very good for the price.. fit well..,4,36
Was a gift for Garfield lover she's very happy,4,46
A bit too thin of material otherwise I like it.,4,47
"Thickness less than what is displayed in pic, but the ring is nice for what it cost",4,83
Ordered these for my daughter and she wore them every single day! Good quality and go with anything!,4,100
A little see through not work approved buttttt Halloween party with friends yesss<br />I drank and slept in it and woke up fine haha,4,132
I kind of like it but after wear it for a while it fall down,4,60
Nice but looks more like a shirt instead of dress,4,49
Lovely shirt but it runs small,4,30
I got these swim shorts for my husband.  They're a nice material and fit true to size.  He was a little disappointed in the fake fly (it's stitched to look like a fly but doesn't operate like one).  He also likes the elastic with the tie string.,4,245
I hated the way they fit,4,24
Fun costume accessories,4,23
I like the size and number of card pockets. The only small downside is that the coin pocket zipper has a zipper pull that is too small. Hopefully it won’t break. The card pockets are a little too tight but will probably stretch and be fine.  Glad I got it.,4,256
Nice material and fits vert comfortably. I'm 5'0 and I got a S/M.,4,65
♥️❤❤❤❤,4,6
I like the color but it’s too large,4,35
cheap and easy work watch. not worried about breaking or losing it at my rough and tough job and it works great.,4,112
It was a little big and way poofier than expected but still a great skirt,4,73
Fuzzy and warm and oh so cute.,4,30
very cute and fun. well made,4,28
"It was cool for a costume, not something I would wear everyday.",4,63
Delivered on time and looks like we expected.  Happy with the costume.,4,70
Light enough to wear while bike riding or running. Comfortable fit.,4,67
"Thick and comfy, good for hiking. Wish they have more color choice.",4,67
Everyday shorts.,4,16
I love love love it! The sizing is a little off. I got it a size bigger so that it would be loose on my finger and it still fit too snug I gave it to my niece,4,158
They're.,4,8
I ordered black. It was surprisingly nice and did not look cheap,4,64
Beautiful ! Looks exactly as pictured.,4,38
These are perfect for my Sally Jupiter cosplay. They are comfortable to wear and arrived in good time.,4,102
My grandaughter loves this!!!,4,29
This is a Christmas gift for my son as he loves this game. Shirt is a little thin but I love that because he gets hot easily. Came very quickly as well.,4,152
"Fine for the price, a little thin, but some extra cushion at the heel",4,69
"Good quality, very soft. The ""baby/toddler"" description is not accurate as this could nearly fit and adults head",4,112
like em,4,7
It worked great for Halloween!,4,30
I use this to lay in bed and listen to music to drown out noise.,4,64
great item & price!,4,19
I am 5'4&#34; and I weigh 150lbs This designed fit my body shape very well.,4,75
Way to small not even close to a XXL,4,36
Very comfy and looks good with anything,4,39
Simple design but way cool. Images are sharp. Just note size: subtle bout 1/2”,4,78
A bit snug but they are nicely made,4,35
"I had to buy a little bit of fabric to add to the section at the breast because it is see-through. Once I added that fabric, the dress was nice. It is well made for the price.",4,175
"Very nice for dress cloths, nice and warm!",4,42
The fit is good but it is a little shorter than expected.,4,57
"The emblems are a bit smaller than expected, but ok for the money.",4,66
"Beautiful color, but it was very long, and the fabric was hot and clingy.",4,73
Have cleaned everybodys rings successfully and they are delighted!,4,66
I knew going in that clothing listed by this vendor are not US sizes. To fix this minor issue because they don't tell you where these come from just order one size bigger than your normal. Shirt is built very well and warm.,4,223
"I like it.  The plastic drill head that digs into the sand needs to be more sturdy.  It twisted up today when I was sinking it in the beach today to set the umbrella.  That said, the umbrella has some really smart features and is our go to for a day on the sand here in Cape Canaveral, FL.",4,289
Cute. A bit pricey for a novelty sock but good quality.,4,55
"Cute but run a little small. The lace tears pretty easily and I've already had to repair toe seams, however I am probably wearing them more than the average person (I don't like to wear socks with my low cut slip on shoes, but if I don't the shoes get stinky. So I wear a pair of these daily.)",4,293
"Same here, it took a while but I do like them.",4,46
has a lower waist then I expected ok to wear around the house,4,61
"I really wanted to love this dress! The color was perfect, material high quality but it was just too short. I'm 5'8&#34; and you could see my booty.",4,148
"I liked these caps.  Very light on my head. Not too tight.  Good variety of colors and designs.  Would have purchased the Color- 25, but the patterns on the cap resembles pictures of “little black sambo”! That part I don’t like!",4,228
It a little flimsy and very wide. I have a huge head and it was even too big on me.,4,83
"Nice shirt,",4,11
was able to pass along to someone smaller.  great price,4,55
Cute shirt but way too small compared to regular shirt sizes but the shirt is nice and thick quality.,4,101
This is a well made costume however it’s kind of short in the torso. I sized up and it fit well but it’s not long enough. I’m 5’9” 165 lbs,4,138
Rose fell off in package. Simple fix with glue,4,46
"nothing to complain, just perfect fit",4,37
Arrived right on time. It was exactly what I was anticipating. These are ideal to wear to work.,4,95
these r cute but they fall off easily,4,37
I love this dress! Very cute and flattering on. It fits pretty much as expected. Perfect summer dress!,4,102
it's very cute and comfortable! I'm a little on the thicker side and went with a large but I'm going to order an xl next time for more room to button the front. all in all though I really love it!,4,196
I do wish that I would have went up a size but it still fits well. I just like things looser,4,92
"A big, super tough duffel.",4,26
Love these! I had ordered a large and had to return because the bra was to tight. Ordered a XL instead fit great!,4,113
Fabric is nearly as heavy and stretchy as I'd hoped but it's adequate for my needs.,4,83
Like color and use in my jeans.,4,31
I like the variation of different colors. I bought it for my galaxy watch 3.,4,76
I think I would like another color than black.,4,46
Got his for my fiancé who is very tired of people not following the proper mask guidelines lol he says it’s not very classes friendly tho,4,137
I enjoyed the thicker material because I am always cold. I am a size medium so I ordered a medium however if your around my size. 36B pants size 7 U.S. And have a little curve to you.  I would try a small so it can hug your body better.,4,236
great hat,4,9
Really liked the design on the band. Was a bit stuff and hard to attach.,4,72
This shirt is one of the best fitting ones I've gotten from Amazon.,4,67
Purchased as Birthday Gift and it was a big &#34;hit&#34; as well as being surprised at how well made the garment is for the price paid!,4,136
I like them! They are beautiful and cute. Beautiful colors my daughter loved them all.,4,86
Product was good quality and fit as expected !,4,46
Too longer than expected to ship but fits great and color is close to picture,4,77
"I am a size 4, 5'8&#34; tall, about 135 lbs. This dress fit me really well. The neck was a little too loose, but had i ordered a small instead of a medium, the waist would have been too tight for me. Everyone complemented me. Love it!",4,234
They're a nice size. A little thinner than I wanted and the gold color is more like 18K gold color. They are a great earring for the price.,4,139
Fit and looks exactly as shown and described,4,44
"Overall, for the price, what I expected. The detail isn't that polished on the dice, but again for the price it is a fun item to have.",4,134
Good product for what I had in mind. Plenty of hair. I was having trouble getting the fabric ears to stand up.,4,110
perfect!!n Material is soft! Im 5'4 34C and perfect fit!,4,56
"Very beautiful, but not exactly comfortable!! The back part was rubbing at first, the strap near your toes was a bit loose, maybe because I have skinny feet?<br />Also the title says Velcro, but mine was not Velcro at all.",4,222
A little larger then expected but still very soft and comfortable,4,65
"My son loves it. Very shear, breathable",4,39
they helped my feet and legs and looked good,4,44
Beautiful earrings! Great size for young ladies and for those who want a smaller but substantial look.,4,102
Nice gold belt I'm going to use in making a roman era costume and it would be great to wear when I go dancing too! I have a 34 inch waist and it even sat on my hips on the last hooks.,4,183
"I like the way they fit, they are very comfortable. I ware them for swim shorts. I am 62 .",4,90
The color is great. The case is easy to put together. I have had this case for approximately 1.5 months and the  part that covers the on/off button broke. I am rather displeased but only on that one issue.,4,205
Have stretched but still a tad tight,4,36
Cute dress and love the pockets... however it definitely needs accessories to make this truly a cute find!! :),4,110
It is a cute set. The top is a little on the small side. The pants fit well.,4,76
I wish material was thicker,4,27
"This watch is a stunning Beauty. But with that said it got four stars because the strap lasted less than 20 hours , good thing I didn't buy for the strap",4,153
It was a gift. He loved it. Fit him good.,4,41
"Good quality, although the plastic shield is too soft so your vision will be a bit blurry when wearing it.",4,106
"Wish the lapis had more color variation, but the blue was lovely",4,64
Love it! fix 2 to 3 person! Wish is was auto open,4,49
"good quality comfortable leggings, however not as tight as i wouldve liked, kinda could feel them coming down a little when i run",4,129
They fit my fat head perfectly but the lenses are not red as depicted in the image. A good buy for someone who loses sunglasses often.,4,134
"I wear these every day, and they don't tarnish which is awesome. The only thing is the prongs are a bit loose on some of them. Great buy for the money tho!",4,155
These are very cute.  My mom loved them.,4,40
Love it but a little small,4,26
"Looks great,but the LED eyes aren't working.",4,44
"I am 5'9"", 135 and the small in this sweater is just a little too small. Sent it back. Feels super warm and good quality for the price.",4,135
Very happy,4,10
I have a small head so this is a bit too big but other than that it looks excellent and looks great.,4,100
It is well constructed and because it looks so different it gets a lot of attention when I go to meetings and such.,4,115
I love this. This holds my Dad’s  ashes. It’s simple end beautiful.  I receive many compliments.<br />This is my second one. Be sure to use Locktite when closing it up. My dad is out there somewhere when my original one come apart.,4,231
"Gorgeous shoe, super cute. Ordered them for my 4.5yr old daughter for family photos. Ordered the correct corresponding size and it did fit ... but barely ... so they do seem to run a bit small. I would recommend sizing up.",4,222
Good purchase.,4,14
I loved the costume but for me it was little small in the butt and hip area but still a nice costume,4,100
I love these shoes.,4,19
"It's a pretty dress, but high waisted on me, and I wasn't expecting that.  I found a very wide belt to wear with it, but wish it didn't need that to bring it to my waist...and I'm not high waisted in my build.  I like it though.  Stylish.",4,238
"Well made, fast service.",4,24
"As they indicated, it took some time to receive but the retailer was totally upfront about that.  It is a great size and, for the cost, I think it's a good value.",4,162
Somehat small and tend to cause swollen ankles,4,46
Gift.  Well made!,4,17
AWSOME backpack! Fits a ton of stuff and is so sturdy. I was shocked by the good quality for the small price I paid. Only problem is it didn't fit my extra larger binder well.,4,175
A little smaller than I thought but love the phone pocket and long strap,4,72
Beautiful watch. Lumin on it is nice,4,36
Runs small but nice and light weight. Great for office use when it gets cold.,4,77
"I liked the pattern of this dress. Really love the pockets. Bought a large because i always fluctuate between a 12 and 14. Would have given 5 stars if it fit correctly and wasnt past my toes.  I can recommend this for anyone over 5'7"". I'm  5-5""",4,245
Love this! This is the second thing I’ve bought from this seller and I am pleased again! It fits and looks exactly as I expected. Hoping it will hold up in the wash just like the first dress I bought from them.,4,210
"Really cute and works great. But, smaller than expected. Definitely sized more for children’s size head.",4,104
Really good studs.,4,18
really cute! Some were a bit white trash but was worth buying the whole set! Never unclipped while doing activities :),4,118
This shirt is super cute. But no tags or anything. As a gift it won't look like u bought it new without any tags or even a size tag. Strange.,4,141
"Really very cute. Fabric is thin, but doesn't appear to be see through. Fit is flattering and tight in the right areas. Would not wear to work, but definitely after work!",4,170
I’ve had it maybe a month and the black lettering has worn to silver so it’s hard to read,4,89
For the price this watch is hard to beat,4,40
Don’t let the picture fool you I assume that this was a solid hand that was 3-D but it is actually flat.,4,104
"This watch was a sound purchase & it goes with my work suit, quite nicely.  I only took off a star because the fastening mechanism had randomly popped open from time to time, during wear - but overall, that is the only minor thing I've noticed.",4,244
Well made and very nice.. Have 4 stars because it was MUCH bigger than the pic made it out to be.. But still very nice bag. It could fit a whole laptop computer in it and you wouldn't even know.,4,194
These fit great and as expected. My son loved them. Give them only 4 start because I felt like the toe did wear out quickly and he ended up with a hole in them even before summer was up.,4,186
"Runs big, but are the perfect accompaniment for the Joules rain boots.",4,70
Good quality just a little to big to be used as handbag. Its good though for a bag for your books for school.,4,109
The quality is very good. They were much smaller than expected.,4,63
Can’t fit me and the cat,4,24
It's a very nice belt. can NOT give it a 5 star rating because I ordered black and recieved tan. So I returned it.,4,114
My daughter picked this for a wedding dress - it was stunning.,4,62
Wish it was a zipper instead of buttons,4,39
"Somewhat small. It fits, but it's stretched a little thin (I'm usually a size 10.5 or 11 men's US shoe). Very light and cool feeling - a  bit like a stocking.",4,158
A little on the ‘tight’ side be wearable,4,40
I already own this band in the Green/black and love it. Bought the red/black one for my wife but upon receiving definitely wouldn't call it red. It has a slight orange color to it. Love the band and brand but the red one just wasn't the color I was wanting.,4,257
"they run a little small, I would size up next time",4,50
"love the interchangeable lenses. But,  a year later and one side of the lens doesn't snap. securely in place anymore. Still wearable but irritating since I'm sure the lens will fall out when I'm running one day.",4,211
"I am a 34D, so I usually fill out most tops. I got a Medium, but I probably needed a Small - it is a bit big in the chest area but I will just do some creative stuffing :)",4,171
"Thank you for getting it right, I hate returning purchases.",4,59
Nice top.  Great for layering.,4,30
Great dress!  Well made. Zipper sticks a bit so watch that. The middle has s piece that’s see through and the top lace is see through but other than that the dress is great. My daughter is a ladies large and we bought a xxl,4,223
My son loves his ring . It looks very nice on him.,4,50
Cute shirt! Fits exactly as expected,4,36
"Very flattering cut, nice full skirt, good length.<br />I'm 5 foot 11 and got the XL. It was comfortable without being baggy.",4,125
"I’m 5’5 and these are the XL. They are a little long on me but I still think they are cute. Love them. This is my 2nd pair. The 1st pair the zipper broke, but i was sent a replacement fast.",4,189
Quality construction and large enough to fit my glasses and the clip on in one case.,4,84
I like the sweater . It's light weight . Perfect for a cool spring / summer cover . Runs small,4,94
Just received them - appears well made product. Washed them before use and tumble dried them - drying took a lot longer than I expected. Comfortable. I hope they hold up long term.,4,180
Looks great but the fabric is definitely fairly heavy.,4,54
Really big sizing,4,17
"Fun, reasonably well made earrings for the low price.",4,53
My daughter loved them..,4,24
Simple but elegant,4,18
If the boob portion was made bigger and the straps were thicker it would have gotten 5 stars,4,92
"This sweater is soft, comfy and runs a little big but that's what I love about it. This is definitely made well and can be dressed up or down, so I can go from work to dinner and not have to worry about changing. Love the vibrant color which is not something I would normally wear but it looks good.",4,299
These work great for my little leaguer!  Durable and comfortable on the field.,4,78
Liked very much!,4,16
"Surprise for my husband for Father's day. The loves the fit, and comfort. He's a 10.5 and I ordered 11. They are a little tight but have stretched out just enough to fit snug but not slide off.",4,193
5’11” and a Large is comfortable with plenty of room.  Medium would fit but not much room for under shirts.,4,107
Real comfy and definitely long enough. I’m 6 foot and they go down to my ankles. A little loose on the waist so sometimes they fall down. Overall good buy.,4,155
Great price super fast shipping true to size and very comfortable.<br />Nice details such as piping and buttons.<br />Would purchase again.,4,139
Love them. Very cute. We use themvinsteadb ofv pants for easy diaper changes on our 6 month old. Shes in the 9850th percentile for weight with chunky legs but the stay in place without cutting off the circulation. We think they're adorable!,4,240
Hungry,4,6
"This shirt is comfortable and has held up well after several washings.  I gave four stars because the sleeves are a little too billowy, but it is still a nice everyday shirt.",4,174
Thin. Very thin but beautiful.,4,30
good quality and funny style!,4,29
"Lovely fabric, fit perfectly",4,28
"These pants fit well on the hips and butt, although they are loose in the waist. Look really good!",4,98
Perfect for pregnancy!,4,22
"Look closely at the size. The photo and description say 17&#34; Wide.  That is at the top, MAYBE if you pull open both sides at the same time,  as it sits I got 16&#34; at the top, and a little shy of 13&#34; across the bottom. Very cute bag, so dissapointed that it was too small.",4,281
A little smaller than what I thought they would be and the stones aren’t very pink but they’re adorable on my 1 year old!! The locking backs are great so she doesn’t pull them out!!,4,181
"Absolutely love these. Gorgeous and I always get compliments when I wear them. As expected, they're heavy, so they visibly stretch my earlobes when I wear them. Personally worth it for me, but everyone's different.",4,214
"I was first upset that it was late, but I love the colors so that's why I bought it. The front seems a bit high from maybe it being bent while it was being shipped.",4,164
"Bought it for my son, he loves it! Shared link with his friends. Great quality!",4,79
Great for the prIce,4,19
These indeed helped a little but not as much as I had expected. Thry are a fair quality and look cute on.,4,105
HAVE NOT WORN THEM YET. TIME NOT RIGHT AS I AM GOING TO WEAR THEM FOR GOLF.  THEY FIT  FINE.,4,92
Looks Great and seems to be durable; good price.,4,48
Great color.  Classic key holder,4,32
"Overall beautiful dress, great for the summer it’s very light. Bottom skirt is somewhat see through but can be worn with shorts under. My daughter is 2.5 years and ordered the 3t-4t fits perfect! The top part is more of a light blue denim color then shown. Would buy different styles!",4,284
"I really liked it, but just this, I’m 5”2 165lb<br />XL was too large for me<br />I would try Medium or large.",4,110
"Fine boot, well made with lots of toe room. However, said in the discription that the boot was steel toe but it is not. Need steel toe for work so I had to return them.",4,168
My daughter wears 7-8 in US size so I ordered an 8. It's too big on her so she won't be able to wear them on her Halloween bday.  We have to wait until she could fit into them now but it is better big than small. ☺,4,214
It has the perfect height but needed to do some sewing to extend the middle area,4,80
Shipping took a long time and was then delayed another four days. However it is a great mask. My hubby loves it. Fits perfectly and is exactly as pictured.,4,155
"Very cute dress.  I ordered a large because I am a size 10-12.  Kind of big and should have ordered a medium, which would have fit perfect.  Washed up nice on perma-press cycle and did put in dryer for about 10 minutes and hung up.",4,231
Arrived way earlier than expected. Very spacious and a place for everything! Goes great with my MK bag :),4,105
I needed it get pass airport security as I am a frequent traveller...,4,69
This is perfect!!  Beautiful and fits amazing! Have 4 stars instead of 5 because it took a month and a half to get it 😳,4,119
Love this bag.,4,14
Everything was exactly as I was expecting except that it costs more than maybe it's worth and was smaller than I had originally planned.,4,136
"Good quality for the price, nice design, fit was stretchy- zipper was a bit tricky, and length was a bit too long.",4,114
Nice fit. But not really rainbow it's more like purple was a little disappointed,4,80
"He's comfortable in them but he's 5""7 and the pants run too long and the sleeves too long also.  So he rolls them up but he's satisfied with them",4,145
THE CHAIN IS A LITTLE CHEAP...BUT THE SENTIMENT IS GREAT!,4,57
Great fit and excellent optics.,4,31
"I was looking for something that would be cool to wear in the summer, and this fit the bill.",4,92
"The quality is, as always, Very good! The color is not as pictured. Oh well, it was a gift and they like it.",4,108
Glove keep you warm and touch screen finger work well. A bit to bulky but its perfect for cold snowy weather.,4,109
everyone likes this dress. the color is just as describe. would order in other colors if they have! :),4,102
Finish is great! Slightly heavy but very nice,4,45
Not bad shoes<br />They have nice padding inside<br />They fit good like any other adidas<br />The same size on every shoe,4,122
Very nice but also very slick.  Slides out of back pockets wen you sit down,4,75
"The top part is very form fitting. But, the dress is comfortable and does not wrinkle or ride up. I am happy with it.",4,117
"Well honestly it doesn't do much for my figure, but my wife likes wearing it.",4,77
Good stocking stuffer this year. Chain is a little strange though. Mother of pearl accent is very pretty! Well priced for dolphin lovers!,4,137
"I really like this crop tank as a layering piece under sweaters, shirts and jackets.  It is also thick enough to be worn on its own .  The fit is really good and the fabric is nice and feels good on.  Order your regular size.",4,225
These are cute!! True to their size(5 us) no green fingers or anything! They kinda bother me but that's my own fault because i write a lot (school) but will def buy silver ones!,4,177
"Es muy grande pero bonito, era un regalo espero que les guste, y que sea duradero",4,81
"Love this pin! Color of cat was slightly off, a bit greenish. A little pricey as well, but i really wanted pin. Reminds of my white cat, she drinks my water all the time!",4,170
"These were not quite what I wanted, thicker than I expected and I am not sure I can use them.  If not, I will gift them.  They are colorful.",4,140
The cutest Christmas pictures from this outfit love it! Sheds though so it was a little messy,4,93
I like the fit of the vest but it is alot thinner then it looks in the picture.,4,79
LIttle difficult to get on and off. But they dry very quickly and are quite durable. Perfect for getting in and out of the shower.,4,130
It is a beautiful dress fits really nice. I received it on time .The material a little thin but because the piping around neck and sleeves have a much better material it look beautiful overall. I recommend that u wear something under it I normally wear 12-14 and I took a Xlarge,4,278
It is the perfect retro swimsuit. Cute and sexy at the same time! I would suggest you measure yourself before choosing a size. I usually wear a 10US and ordered a large.,4,169
Quality and s good,4,18
"I got this with the intention my daughter would wear to cheer practice. The problem is that it is so long it covers her shorts too. My daughter always wears a size large no matter the brand, but this shirt is so long. It fits in every other way, but much longer than her shorts.",4,278
"My son doesn’t like to wear shoes often,  but he will wear these. Sometimes I think it’s tight on the back of his ankle just because it has to be so they stay on.. anythinf digs in a tiny bit after a while. But they were cute and worked I like them",4,248
"For being 'big and tall' socks, I was surprised that they are no bigger around the ankle than my regular sized gold toes. I wear size 13-14 shoe, but my ankles aren't very wide, so this is a little disappointing. They are otherwise well made and have a quality feel to them.",4,274
I love these socks for cold weather and specifically for snowboarding. They are thick so need some room in boots to wear them but definitely will keep you warm and are very comfortable.,4,185
Here's a wonderful occasional-wear watch. I like it very much. Just a tiny bit heavy for continuous wear on my old wrist. The big numbers are excellent.,4,152
"This are very good gloves at a very reasonable price, good heavy fabric, protects your arms from scratches, I have used them already and they work very well and I am very pleased.",4,179
I was looking for a new patriotic hat after my old one wore out.  This fit the bill.,4,84
Nice hat! It could have had a circle of tiny vent holds for steam release from the top.  The hat is made of straw so it would warm ya up!<br />the tie holders didn't keep the ties up for wind blow but hey!  Other than that...oh well.,4,233
"The perfect variety pack. A pair for the car, the purse, the night stand, the desk, and the kitchen. No metal pieces touch my skin so no breakouts or scarring. Will be ordering again.",4,183
For great! It was perfect for what i was wearing it too!,4,56
"Very cute casual shirt but runs very small. If you want it to fit like it does in the picture, I’d suggest ordering at least one size up.",4,137
"Nice band, fits well.",4,21
Nice looking wallet. It’s super stiff though. My fiancé has had it for about a year and he still has a hard time getting his cards out.,4,135
"I love the face of the watch.  Very easy to read.  However, the wrist band, because of what it's made of, seems to get white specs all over it that make it look rather tacky.",4,174
Decent looking shoe for the price.,4,34
"Good size, and good price.",4,26
Bought for granddaughter. She loves the shoes!,4,46
"I like it, it's comfy.",4,22
My daughter likes it so I bought her another set.,4,49
My husband LOVES this robe!! His only complaint... he gets a little too warm in it sometimes... but he wears it all of the time...,4,130
"These are very nice panties and I bought a size up as recommended. I wear size 6 but ordered a Large. It's okay, but a size XL would probably be better.",4,152
Bien hasta ahora,4,16
the dress is very pretty but runs a little smaller than I thought it would.,4,75
I gave it a 4 star because one of the straps was way longer when sown onto the mask and it makes it awkward to wear like that. So I ended up modify it to my like and it still looks like I bought it that way. Besides that it’s awesome!,4,234
Great job at keeping the pocket square folded and neat.,4,55
Love the jacket. The only thing is the zipper is on the women's side. It's made unisex though. Fits great. Good quality.,4,120
It was just the right size - not to big or small. I replaced the chain because I wanted it to hang a bit lower. Nice display and variety of coloration.  I thought it was a great value.,4,184
Very pleased with the quality of these gloves. The fabric is stretchy enough to fit. Not as long as I would have thought but still a good product for the price. Would recommend it to my friends and family.,4,205
"This is a very nice labradorite piece, however its more of a guitar pick shape than a heart. Still a beautiful necklace, my daughter loved it.",4,142
"I like nubra better, still did a good job!",4,42
Brought this for my sister she loves it so much.,4,48
"This belt is just perfect,for the price It's just awesome ,I know just am gonna be wearing it for a  long time",4,110
Great shirt for a Clementine cosplay,4,36
"Nice hat, is darker than the picture makes it out to be. Could be a lil bigger. Does not fit my big head as good as I would like it to.",4,135
"Ordered this with the hopes that I could you it as a jacket but was pleasantly surprised.of the quality. Nice thick flannel, colors are bright and fits great. Order to true size.",4,178
Nice texture but too small. If you fill it with cards it barely closes. The card slots are so small it's hard to get cards in and out.,4,134
"These silicone nose pieces last much longer than the last style that I purchased, however they still only stay on my glasses for less than one week before the glue dissolves and no longer sticks. I hope to find a brand in the future that uses a more permanent glue.",4,265
It is very soft. The graphic is very sweet,4,42
Very nice top...,4,16
"At first I was disappointed, and almost returned these because I thought they came with an integrated “ball pouch”.. they don’t, just a contour up front.. but decided to keep them and they have worked well as everyday boxer briefs, the cotton mix is just right.. quality is better than I expected",4,296
I purchased these shoes for my dad. He has very large callouses on his feet and has a hard time wearing shoes that have a closed heel. He loves these shoes and wears them daily !,4,178
I do actually like the bag I at first didn’t but now after using the big bag I love it ! The strap did break but I was able to make it work I wouldn’t put heavy items in it it snapped right off. Anyway I still like it,4,217
Nice dress bur runs small,4,25
Cute but order a size down its long. I love it but you will have to layer or throw on a cute cardigan or jacket.,4,112
It was a beautiful little chain but very dainty. It was for a 7 year old that is very active. Not heavy enough for her.,4,119
"The leather is s bit more stiff than other brands of ""apple"" type watch bands.",4,78
"Love the color,pretty blue color!!!",4,35
Great product for what you pay for (quality and everything),4,59
Received this today. Nice and light and feel great on my face. Dual shading on the lenses are darker on top and make for no glare at all. Would definitely recommend.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount so I can give my honest review,4,245
"This is an elastic belt! For me, its more cosmetic than actually helping keep my pants up. Does look very nice.",4,111
"very cute, will make nice hang tags for jewelry",4,47
"Looks good fits pretty well. Was the color scheme I like. Worn & washed a few time, no change. It was a little high priced but I feel I got what I wanted so that was little concern",4,180
"Cute, gets dirty. Durable chain",4,31
Very cute pair of everyday shades.,4,34
Very comfortable although the padding is a bit thin....but overall I like them.,4,79
"These are super comfortable, but minus one star because the sleeves are a bit short for my liking. Would’ve appreciated another inch or two of fabric to cover my upper arms. As it is my shoulders are practically popping out of the sides. They fit really well otherwise.",4,269
Nice ring but was a little uncomfortable. I modified the inside of the ring so it would be more comfortable. Edges were not rounded so it kind of dug into the finger. It still is nice though and with the modifications I wear it all day no issues.,4,246
"Runs small, size 1 up.",4,22
"Love these shorts. Very comfy, and light weight perfect for hot summer months. I plan to buy more.",4,98
Looks a little flimsy but it’s great to just wear on occasion.,4,62
Its a nice bra it just wasn't my size.,4,38
I love this logo! Sweatshirt was amazing- my niece was beside herself excited! But it runs so small I had to reorder her 2 sizes up! Buy it big!!!,4,146
Surprisingly good quality socks. Should last a few years as I wear them only on games days. Go Zags!,4,100
Great size and shape. Hang down nicely. Colors go with many outfits.  Only a small issue (personally) with the metal used ~,4,123
"Super soft but they’re too cropped, I thought from the photo that they were full length.",4,88
"Overall, I like the suit. It was just too big, and they didn't have the color I wanted in the next size down.",4,109
Okay as usually,4,15
Some what smaller than the us standard sizes,4,44
I ordered these for my boyfriend and he loves how durable and comfortable they are.,4,83
fast shipping nice big bags,4,27
returned because coral pink was wrong coral for my wardrobe,4,59
Fabulous earrings.  I will buy the black ones.  The color is off however.  They are much lighter than the photo,4,111
Just fine for the price.,4,24
"Super comfy. Liked the one I ordered for my mother so much I ordered one for myself. But, the color was not as shown so I returned. Very good quality and easy to return. Would have ordered a replacement but, they didn't have the black in my size.",4,246
I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. Being able to get them in two days with my Prime membership was a added bonus.,4,129
"A little long to wear with jeans, cute with leggings",4,52
"Normally a 36C and ordered a large. Was hoping to wear last few weeks of pregnancy but was too tight. Fits a little on the small side now postpartum, especially when breasts are fuller between feeds. Overall very happy with this bra and love the texture of the fabric.",4,268
"Nice goggles, fit well with no leaks.",4,37
I didn't have them for very long when the gloves started to develop little burs.... They're relatively warm; they're great for wearing in chillier weather (that doesn't quite warrant full-out mittens) or in a cold building. I like wearing them. :),4,247
"I bought this watch to wear while my good watch is being repaired.  I am really pleased with my purchase, it was delivered on time and fits my small wrist.  The watch has a small piece of plastic around the crown which you remove to start the battery.  Nice little watch.",4,271
"%T Fit's as expected for my almost 5 year old, he is on the taller side, wouldn't get any smaller for sure. The print is a little crusty feeling, but I figure he'll only wear for the month of December. Haven't washed to see how it holds up.",4,240
So far so good.  Very clear view underwater.  Stays on my head without letting water in.  The clasp in the back is better than the ones that just have a rubber strap.  I just hope they hold up!,4,193
"Very cute jacket however, the inside button fell off while trying it on. It's an easy fix, just not expected for a new item.",4,124
nice. thanks,4,12
Some zippers stick a little so it's annoying but otherwise nice with pockets. I take a diaper wipes and snack. So doubles as a mini diaper bag for me!,4,150
"Tight fit. Wish they came  in sm, med, large rather than sm/med or lg/xlg.  I would have definitely ordered a medium.",4,117
this matrial a bit thinner but good brand,4,41
Pretty nice for the price. Love the color and it fits nicely.,4,61
"beautiful, but stones are now falling out and I can't find one to replace it.",4,77
"Fit well, very comfortable. Great for running errands, around the house or to work out in",4,89
"I like color of the cap and how it fits, and have gotten thank you's from strangers for serving in the military. To improve the hat, I would suggest curving the brim a little less.",4,180
Fit exactly as expected per size ordered.  The white dots were missing from the image print but overall it was pretty nice.,4,123
"These are super warm socks and I love them around the house. They are very thick to wear with boots, I think you’d need to go a a half or even a  full size larger to wear these. They aren’t tight around the cuff which I think would annoy me to wear with boots",4,259
bigger than I expected,4,22
This was a surprise but in good way shirt fit perfectly and the quality of the material was top notch. And it looks great with either dress pants or jeans,4,154
"This is very warm and light weight.  The only issue I have with it is the neck.  If I leave it open it doesn't hang well, snapping it up is too warm for my neck.",4,161
I would buy two inches more the nextime I will for my size 28 so in the future i will buy 29 or 30 great clothe to wear :),4,122
Perfect clear bag and meets NFL stadium requirements.,4,53
Very happy with the product. :-),4,32
Large was too small... gave it to my daughter... she loves it!!,4,63
So cute! Perfect for a lumberjack-theme party this month in FL! Large fit as expected.  Buttons are small.,4,106
these are the perfect size,4,26
Really soft fabric- the tie key hole stretches so that my bra shows though I am busty at a 34DD.,4,96
"Not sure if it shrunk a little bit after the first wash, but it was a little small on me. It is a nice shirt though. Will just buy XL from here out.",4,148
"Cute, so soft, good quality and great price! Fits as expected. Order your true size. It’s stretchy as well. I ordered large which is what I wear in shirts and fits perfect",4,171
These are cool. The pins are difficult to install,4,49
Runs a little small had to purchase another size. Very cute and hopefully I can use it in some outfits to show off the neat back.,4,129
I love it! Perfect for my meditation.,4,37
It is beautiful as the picture but it is very big so I had to take out a lot of links in it. It fits great now and I like that it is light weight so it doesn't feel heavy after having it on for a long time! I never got the free gift with it.,4,241
"its a very nice watch. you get what you pay for so don't expect amazing quality. that being said, its actually a really nice watch for its price. i have had no problems with it and it looks great",4,195
"This is a nice wrap and I do like it, however, it runs small. I'm not a big person (160 pounds at 5' 4"") and even tho I ordered a much larger size than I normally wear, it's still snug across the bust.",4,201
This product was the exact size and style I was looking for! Very pleased!!,4,75
Glad I purchased this,4,21
My little sister has had this necklace since Christmas and she loves it. It doesn't look like cheap jewelry at all and it holds together pretty nicely.,4,151
It is a really nice shirt i like the little leather embelishments on it.  The sleeves were to short for my arms but the rest fit nice.  Luckily this shirt is made to be rolled up and slide up.,4,192
"Excellent value.  The product looks very good, fit the watch perfectly, and was offered at a very reasonable price - a great deal.",4,130
"Nice print, funny design if you're into that kind of thing. Holds up well under wash. Fabric is super scratchy though, definitely want to wash it a few times with fabric softener.",4,179
"These are great. Soft, fit well and have the compression.",4,57
"haven't use yet, But looks good.",4,32
I love the fabric and the shape. I deducted a star because of the size. They run very small in the waist. I ordered a size up and probably should have ordered two sizes up.,4,172
Soft fabric. It has stretch and i not fitted. I love the color and everything about the pajamas. Love that it has drawstring waist to make wearing more comfortable.,4,164
I like these pieces.  The necklace did have one of the black veneers missing when it arrived.  I glued it back on. The earrings are heavy.  I will be using a disk backing to make them lay correctly.,4,198
Fits a tad snug no grip on bottom of shoes very slick looks as is in photos,4,75
"I ordered a size down. My daughter is 4 and wears a 6, she is tall and skinny. Fit perfectly. I gave one less star because it was wrinkled and I had to steam it. But it came out nicely.",4,185
Came in time and the size is prefect.,4,37
For weekends,4,12
Granddaughter thought it fit weird!,4,35
Swim suit fits great and is True to size,4,40
Product is as I spected!,4,24
Light n compact,4,15
"Fits like a large not xx large, thinner than I liked.",4,53
Good very sexy,4,14
"Nice quality.  Bought a 3X, fits like a 2X.",4,43
"Nice quality, definitely fits on the snug side. Actual shirt is a much brighter salmon pink in person.",4,102
It is a lovely sweater and looks very nice. It fits comfortably and would make a great addition to an outfit to make it more winter worthy.<br />The negative? It is very scratchy. It feels like it’s made from wool but isn’t,4,223
"Love it! Great quality, my phone fits nicely.",4,45
"Very cute earrings.  I love them.  The backs are a little long for a little girl, so I kept them for myself.",4,108
Really nice especially for the price. Live the color.,4,53
"Beautiful dress, definitely like the style.. Ordered a large based on my measurements & it fits & fit nice if I want a bodycon dress mu butt looks good in this. Now for a classy less fitted look I'll be ordering a XL. But it's a keeper.. 38,32,42",4,246
Very cute with the blue crop top I bought,4,41
love it but want bigger side,4,28
"Very comfortable, washed great.",4,31
Really cool just the right size it might actually be perfect the only down side is that the sword case part can fall off at times,4,129
"Love the dress, bought it for work and it looks professional and length is great (not too short). I gave 4 starts because lining is pulling up on the back. It is not noticeable but you can feel it all the time.",4,210
Easy to wear and very comfortable too!,4,38
"cute and comfortable, I like the little ruffle",4,46
Some of the mustaches wouldn't remove from the backing. Others were fine.,4,73
"Nice sweatshirt, need larger sizes.",4,35
Nice pendants but I am not crazy about the necklace. The type that it will come off easily.,4,91
"Great dress for the vertically challenged! Fabric is soft, stretchy, and comfortable. Color payoff matches the item’s description. Slightly transparent in the bust area, but I plan on wearing a white crop top underneath.",4,220
I'm usually a size 8.5 and got a 9 based on other reviews but I should have stuck with my usual size. I either wear two socks each or thick socks with them. They also have a lump at the bottom probably from the way it was made. But the color is a nice white and everything else is fine.,4,286
It’s sore for a bit. But pretty sturdy considering I sneeze a lot 😂 but did you do have to get use to the weight of the magnet,4,126
When I opened it I was upset at first because it wasn't the one I ordered and it is not 2 tier like the description but I do love it and decided to keep it. It's very soft and the lace is gorgeous and still goes well with my dress.,4,231
"Cheap but quality rings, only issue is the clasp is a little tight and hard to maneuver as I have a small nose.",4,111
I love the way this shirt fits me! I cannot find many clothes that fit me right but this shirt does. I am so happy with the way the shirt fits! I would highly recommend this shirt for anyone whose looking for a simple shirt but still a little dressy.,4,250
"Bought the Princess hoodie for my day it fits her great, super soft inside and very comfortable",4,95
"I woukd have given all 5 stars but the quote is a bit hard to read. I got it in my sticking today, great locket :) big chunky, and able to fit pictures easy as pie!!!",4,166
Really cute and fits well but feels cheap and the zipper feels like its constantly about to break,4,97
Bathing suit is nice but the coverup is a joke it must be made for her Doll,4,75
Very pretty just like the picture,4,33
Fabric is a little thin on this but it is not see through.  Love how soft and comfortable it is.  And the pockets are great.  Perfect with booties in the fall or leggings in the winter.,4,185
Love it! Fits great and looks like like the pictures!<br />I wore it Thanksgiving and everyone love it. Buying another for Christmas! 💃🏽<br /><br />Con: the stitching came a loose a little in the back after first washing but the variation in the print allows for easy fixing to go unnoticed.,4,291
Not bad! Fabric is seen through...,4,34
"Very nice! I love this. The style is great, the material is good, it fit me well. It met my expectations and I am pleased with my purchase.",4,139
Quality and feel of cotton and many colors,4,42
t's pretty good.,4,16
I would have liked straps because the bodice was super loose and not supportive.  The wrap around skirt was a bit odd and probably would work better on someone tall.  I’m 5’4.  However for the price it was great for a poison ivy costume.,4,237
"Decent. Length was a little long for me. The quality, for the price, was good.",4,78
I didn't like the way it fit me but the material was good. I gave it too my daughter in law and she loves it.,4,109
pretty as always qiyun is the best,4,34
"It's ok, it came with a filter which is nice. Too bad it doesn't have a nose wire that would have helped.<br />It's washable",4,124
God shirt.  Goes with everything,4,32
I loved it.  But this is my second order on it...the rose fell off the leather strap.,4,85
Will fit over a larger coat if needed,4,37
I love the dress. The opening at the front of the dress does not close properly and I have to use a decorative pin or a safety pin(hidden to make it look ok.,4,157
Accessories,4,11
Good for high energy,4,20
I put on two and cut off the extra chain hanging on the side. Almost a week later I’m still wearing the same two. They didn’t get ruined in the shower. If you take them off everyday they’ll probably last longer. Each one came in its own plastic bag. Can be used as a bracelet,4,275
Got a large she wears an 8 they were snug,4,41
"Very nice pj, it is sort and light.  It is a bit more fitting at the arm, neck, bust then I expected. However I still would order your regular size.",4,148
"I bought larger size so they would fit him loosely, but they are tight & he is only 30 lbs.",4,91
Material is thin. Needed to wear a slip for modesty.,4,52
Loved the masks. They are very pretty,4,37
Looks good! Not as see through as I thought it would be! I think it’s just my body that’s the issue not the fit lol,4,115
Nice dress for the price 😊,4,26
The shoe is very cute. The toe area is a little wide and I have narrow feet so it looks a little weird but still worth it. Fits true to size.,4,141
I ordered a pair of these and they got as expected and I love it. Will order again for sure,4,91
I like the dress and like the style but it was WAY too large,4,60
"The shirt is really nice and fits well; however, I was hoping that the overlay of the arms was a little bit longer and covered more of my upper arms.  Other than that,  I am pleased with the shirt.",4,197
My husband bought this for me to use when I’m painting in my studio. Very handy to slip this on to protect my clothes.,4,118
"I ordered a large which is what I would normally wear but this is pretty tight, probably should of ordered an xlarge. Once I am zipped into the shirt it helps with my posture.",4,175
"It's a cute dress but needs a petticoat to make the skirt flare as it does in the photo. Although I usually wear a medium, I ordered a small based on other reviews and it fits well. I am 5'4&#34; and about 120 lbs.",4,214
Very pretty...  it is as pictured.,4,34
"Nice dress, I usually wear a small, but after reading the comments stating to buy a size up I purchased a medium and it is a little too big but it's ok!",4,152
"While these are very comfy, while wearing I noticed the right leg is much longer than the left! Ummmm. See attached picture. Disappointed<br /><br />UPDATE: Returned and ordered a replacement and they are good! Fits nicely. Super comfy. Thank you!",4,247
The set is beautiful. The side with print is very soft but the interior closet to skin is rough. I am going to wash with softener to see if it helps. The size is as described.,4,175
It’s ok. It seems like sturdy material. Color not as shown.,4,59
I liked the product. It really is a slim card holder.,4,53
This dress is super cute but unfortunately it was too big in the arm holes so the sides dropped.  It’s possible that washing and drying the item would take take of that but I wasn’t willing to take the risk.  Overall though the dress fit my body like a glove and perfect length,4,277
Bought a few of these and I like this one just make a little cheaper than others I've gotten.,4,93
These are probably going to last a long time. They are comfortable- even for my flat feet.,4,90
Great hat just runs slightly small even the xxl fits more like a xl but for the money I can’t complain,4,102
Fast delivery and items were as described. Looks great with jeans.,4,66
For a woman size small it was really tight for my spouse. After 1 wash it's more like a t-shirt now. She still love it.,4,119
me quedo demasiado ajustado.,4,28
"Just like the description says. I ordered Male medium and it fit perfect. Not like other shirts that are not true medium. I like the shirt a lot, but I gave it four stars because its an &#34;OK&#34; material made from fruit of the loom. HD cotton 100% cotton",4,258
"Although this is not heather grey, getting two  pairs of yoga pants for this price was convenient and inexpensive. Thank you.",4,125
"A bit thin on the needle part , but it doesn’t slip so that’s not a big issue. Shines enough when kept clean. Especially if you go out at nightclubs and light hits it (:",4,169
Quality very good.. But a little smaller than most larges.,4,58
"The wand is almost perfect. It came in a nice felt bag and has a great feel and weight to it, however it's not 100% straight and veers off towards the end making it a little unbalanced. Still one of the best wands I've seen.",4,224
I would have liked for the chain to be a little heavier other than that it was fine.  Once I have it attached I'll report back.,4,127
They even look good on me...  A little bit expensive though.  They seem well made and the optics are good.,4,106
These are nice sweatshirts. But I have one complaint. TAGS. Just about every other maker is doing away with them. They are ANNOYING. Yes it is a reason to return them.,4,167
Impressive quick delivery and the helmet is perfect! I totally enjoyed my ride!,4,79
I love LOVE this decal. Perfect for my phone. One star deducted due to the difficulty of application. I love decals and apply them to many things/surfaces and this one was a bit of a pain. With some patience it will turn out fine. Just be careful and take your time applying. You'll love it.,4,291
This looked very elegant for my daughters prom. Didn’t look cheap.,4,66
"These were good, nice color, no odor",4,36
Nice quality. This is a thinner material than most hoodies. The sizes are listed in EU sizes. I ordered a Large and received a US Medium/EU Large. Had to exchange for the size listed as XL which is actually a US Large. Size up on this one.,4,239
These rocks are great for painting. And I think they are nice size. However I do think the price is very high. I’ve purchased 2 bags recently but I doubt I’ll order any more for that price,4,188
"Nice, conservative, probably will last well.  Too much like the one I have - kinda boring.",4,90
"I wish this was about 2 inches longer. Otherwise, it's nice looking, holds my glasses, and not overly obvious/flashy.",4,117
Shirts were great and fit true to size.,4,39
"Took 3 weeks longer than said. Said was shipped in US, but I dint think so",4,74
"Great package, easily giftable<br />Mirror hanging reminder, not used as necklace",4,81
"Nice,it look very good on my face and it is very clear.",4,55
"I really like the style of this dress and the fabric feels great, but for me the dress is too short.  It hit above the knee and for me that doesn’t work.",4,153
Cute dress but the salmon pink color is see through. It's not the best quality but it's adorable and worth it.,4,110
"Bought this hat and gloves for my husband who was stationed in Ft. Knox, Kentucky.  Kept him warm then and keeps him warm now at football games.",4,144
Beautiful but does not hold the glasses. Kept slipping out. I bought the V eeer fra Bradly also and had some problem.  So disappointed.,4,135
"I like this necklace, however, it arrived slightly defective. After some fixing of my own, its better. Didnt feel like the hassel of sending it back.<br />Also, it is a little short so i would have to add an extension link.",4,223
I like the design and the price. Price reasonably.,4,50
"Love the pattern and it fits great, but was surprised to see other reviewer said it looks whiter than picture because mine is more gray. Still very cute, just not as &#34;white and blue&#34; as I thought the photo made it look.",4,227
Mu daughter loved the color and makes the quack quack sounds EVERYTIME she goes with these on while using the potty.,4,116
Pretty. But I thought the chain was a bit skimpy.,4,49
Very cute but cheaper quality than expected.,4,44
"Light is kinda dim not sure if its a original casio, bit the clock ia great i love it",4,85
"It's very cute, but small, so made more for a child than an adult.  My sister wore it and it fit fine, but the tail is short and ears small for an adult.",4,153
The shirt was definitely cute however a size small fits a size US 8-10 in women or much like a medium.  Bought the green long sleeve for myself and the armpits went down to my sides. It fit my mom perfectly though... way more bustier than me! Fabric also seems a little sheer.,4,276
It's nice looking and flexible.,4,31
"It's a cosmetic bag, that's waterproof.  Wife wanted, I bought, she doesn't tell me anything so I don't know if it's any good.",4,126
"It came on time. My only complaints are hard to clean glass, and squeaky glasses frames.",4,88
Nice light fabric looks just like pic,4,37
"My daughter loved it, and that it has pockets.",4,46
"If you have a larger backside, get the largest size you can get. Other than that I love it",4,90
Should have not ordered xl<br />It doesn't run small it's huge!!!!! I normally wear a med/large and should have def ordered large,4,129
These are comfortable and warm at an excellent price. Definately a good deal. I found them to be a little tite getting over a large head(mine) but I think they'll break in. Even so for the price they'll be great for outside work.,4,229
Not made for black women with wide hips. Had to alter the bottom to fit.,4,72
Great color and washes up well with few wrinkles and very little shrinkage. Waist is a bit big but fits well everywhere else. Used a belt and kept on trucking.,4,159
Love it but rather large even with adjustable clip on smallest setting,4,70
"It's a really good high quality shirt.  Unfortunately, my arms could not fit through the arm holes.  I work out a fair amount so I understand it, but it is otherwise a really good shirt.",4,186
These are adorable and true to size. But they fell apart FAST.,4,62
"Not great quality jewelry, but a fabulous costume set for an event I attended with a tiger theme (no one could tell it is really a leopard). Catches are difficult to operate, but I got compliments all evening long.",4,214
"I bought these for my daughter, she is making little coin bags and wanted to put these on the end of the zippers. They worked out just great.",4,141
I’m impressed with the quality of this leotard compared to others I’ve ordered. The fabric is thick and perfectly stretchy. I’d give it 5 stars if the fit was adjusted so that the top was higher cut- it’s a tad low on my 4-year-old.,4,232
"Love this bag, just wish that there was a separate hook for the longer strap. It hooks on the handles diagonally so it crosses a little more.",4,141
Bought this in white and it is absolutely beautiful and delicate looking! Only issue is that it runs a little small.,4,116
On the small side but fits the Pandora bracelet and looks nice.,4,63
"very nice looking watch, nice fit clear fave easily read.I wiould buy another!",4,78
The style is great! A bit too see through for my style.,4,55
I bought a small it fits perfectly. Looks exactly how it’s pictured. It’s medium weight. I like it,4,98
Very soft. I was worried about the little seams that run right up the front of each cup but the fabric is so soft it doesn't matter. I ordered the largest cup in my size and I think I would be more comfortable if I had more coverage. I am always pulling it back up in the front.,4,278
these cargo shorts are a great summer weight along with being cotton the only suggestion is to make them with a separate cell phone pocket.,4,139
Cute. Quality- ok. Nothing special,4,34
Giving 4 stars cuz the color is slightly different than the picture. In reality color is more vivid which I don't desire for this style. Love the fabric and neck cut. I'm 5'10 135lb and purchased small,4,201
Hands of the watch are colored same as the face making the time almost impossible to read.  Anyone with vision<br />problems don't buy this watch.,4,146
I really like the style of this bathing suit but the bottom seems to have stretched out after a couple of wears leaving it a little saggy in the bottom area,4,156
Cute too but very thin and cheaply made.,4,40
This is a cute dress but was not forgiving with my tummy rolls. Would need to wear some kind of shape wear - probably spanx rather than something more lightweight - in order to look nice. Sadly will be sending back until my fat magically disappears.,4,249
It is really big but very cute and works well as a cover up.,4,60
Bought for our kids. These fit a little more snug then expected for our 7-13 year olds. Wish they offered a little more stretch to them.,4,136
as described. size is as expected.,4,34
"This was sturdy enough to stay on and stay standing up, I am not sure what it is made out of - but it exceeded my expectations and I would recommend! It lasted even thru two toddlers playing with it and is still going strong as a dress up item.",4,244
I really like this open front blazer.  It looks very professional. Great for work!,4,82
"This dress is so pretty but the only reason I give it 4 stars is because the top of the dress that covers my chest isn’t big enough. The dress hugs every curve, very tight & thick material. Shipping was 2 days. Hopefully double sided tape helps keep my chest covered because I love this dress",4,292
Good value for money and a decent fit.  Will probably buy again in the future.,4,78
"Look just like the picture,  also aren't too heavy which is nice. Good earrings.",4,80
The fit was perfect - I got medium and am a size 10-12  and they are very comfy. I don’t know how they will hold up but for the price I will give them a try.,4,157
Seemed of good quality 👌,4,24
It's just what I wanted. Not too heavy nor too light.,4,53
Perfect size and great price.  Was not heavy and kept my food nice and cold.  Was perfect to use for a wine tasting picnic.,4,123
I sized up but this was a really cute top!,4,42
Nice little  Wallet,4,19
"Nice gloves, delivery took longer than expected! They fit as expected the material is decent.",4,93
I love it. And its leather. Perfect fit,4,39
"Super cute, compact and perfect for my needs. I do wish there were more slots for credit cards but other than that, the is the one to buy.",4,138
One was slightly damaged when it arrived.  One of the chains was completely missing while several others were broken.  I have experience with ewerly like this so repairing it for me was easy.,4,191
I ordered this for Halloween but realized the quality is better than I thought. I will find other occasions to wear it more often. The sizing chart was accurate for my body. I got size 6.,4,187
It  looks better than I thought it would and was reasonably priced.,4,67
I'd have given these sunglasses 5 stars but I've had them less than two months and the finish has worn off over one eye. It doesn't seem to change looking out but the aesthetic (sp?) has suffered a bit.,4,202
Very elegant!<br />Happy with it so far,4,39
Love these. They're warm too (:,4,31
"Adorable, great quality, size was on the smaller side.",4,54
"I've ordered these tank tops for myself and overall its a very good quality product.<br />Fits in well, material quality is awesome and design is quite stylish.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and will recommend this brand definitely to my friends and family members :)",4,290
"This is a super cute dress, can be dressed up or down",4,53
"I sent this as a gift to my sister.  She absolutely loved it.  After seeing pictures of it, I wish I would have ordered one for myself as well!  It was a good quality for the price, and the colors were just as pictured.",4,219
They are perfect for everyday but i wouldn't wear them to a black tie event/wedding.,4,84
i ordered L and returned for a Med still a tad loose. So I would say runs a lil big. But I haven't washed them so...My measures 29/30 waist 42/44hips,4,149
good to have,4,12
"I have some pins that I like to have on my bag, but they kept losing the backs and I was worried I'd lose them eventually.  These locks have held up nicely and keep my pins in place just like they should.",4,204
"This dress is adorable.  I can’t wait to wear it! Order true to size or down a size- I ordered true to size because I have a larger chest- otherwise, most people can probably go down a size.",4,190
Material thin wire a hole in finger first day,4,45
"I would give it 5 starts but the drawstring was not centered on waist and so it looks a bit off kilter.  Material was nice and fit is good, too.",4,144
I lo es colors,4,14
Adorbs.,4,7
"Very pretty and well made, but very uncomfortable.",4,50
it's thin and perfect for summer time. it does slip off sometime when you're wearing your shoes but that's expected. overall it's a good product for its price.,4,159
"Lenses are great, the frame is a little cheap",4,45
Very sexy swimsuit that hides the bulges. The only reason I have it a 4 is because the strap broke on day one.,4,110
Nice dress.  Fabric is a little thin.,4,37
Great shoe! Very comfortable but I think the heel is much taller than suggested.,4,80
Pretty sweet!,4,13
"Very pretty concept, the fabric is not the best, not the worst. Just kind of like an umbrella type of feel but thicker. The design is beautiful though, except the pants are very long. You’d have to be a super model to not need to hem them.",4,239
Great Quality. Super fast shipping with prime.,4,46
Cute top but obviously is used not new. All tags have been cut out. No brand name no size tag. You can see where they are cut out.  I thought I was buying a new item.,4,166
Not a bad tank for the price,4,28
Brought it to small the dress is beautiful.,4,43
"Item was purchased for a 10 year old, participating in Salvation Army Adapt a Family, team building event at work",4,113
Cute but the shirt runs small,4,29
"I love everything Ecko. Ecko sizes usually are kn the ""larger side"" but not in the case. I bought large and its more like a medium. Other than that, great quality",4,162
Seam started coming undone in the back where the zipper is but it still served its purpose,4,90
These pants are great but really long! I had to hem them up. I am 5' 2.,4,71
Ordered for my son. Item was as expected but shipping took a little longer than I hoped.,4,88
Color .. nice,4,13
super cute and great for &#34;business casual&#34; dress code at work with a tunic or flowy top!,4,96
I have to wear s shirt under it as its wide open in front.,4,58
"Es de estilo playa, súper sencillo, la talla corre grande",4,57
"We bought these as a Birthday gift for a friend, and she really likes them! Subtle but cute.",4,92
I ordered royal blue and got navy so I returned it and reordered another one<br />Liked the dress but it was very snug,4,118
This is a nice hooded tank top,4,30
Really neat and well-made strap. Only minor complaint: It could stand to be a little longer. I'm right between the next to last and the last hole. I bought this for my black Russian Diver. Looks great.,4,201
"Price was right. Arrived next day. Item was as described, fit well.  Now need to use it..that's why only 4 stars.",4,113
"Wasn't a perfect fit to the watch face, but tweaked it just enough to be workable.  Comfortable, good price.",4,108
Cute and really fun. Fit pretty well but you do get what you pay for. I will be surprised if they last a few months.  They are really thin. I normally wear a med or large. I should have ordered the XL in these pants.,4,216
NICE CUT NICE DESIGN BUT WAYYYY TOO SMALL.,4,42
"Shirt took far too long to come ordered the short in my sons size it arrived 2 sizes too small .. My son really wanted the short ended up taking it to my tailor adjust it to fit .. After the first wash it gathered several lint balls , Beautiful shirt however not worth the money ..",4,281
Everything about Volvo is a hit with our Grandson!,4,50
"Modest and comfortable, this dress was a great purchase.<br /><br />It was a little loose in the chest area in a medium but a small was too tight. I kept the medium, and I wore it with a jacket so you couldn't really tell then.",4,227
Not really 12 mo. More 9 mo size.,4,33
"Pretty color, love that it has pockets. The material is a more heavy than expected and it's a little more dressy than expected. Overall, happy with my purchase.",4,160
"Fit small. 5’9” , 210 and I went with the xxl.<br /><br />I can’t speak to durability as I’ve only worn them 3x and I hand wash my kits.<br /><br />2nd ride was 73 miles in 90 temps. Bibs were breathable and comfortable the entire day.",4,235
Cute. Bought this for the military ball.,4,40
This scarf has absolutely beautiful and I really like it. I'm really glad I bought it. Now waiting for spring so I can wear it.,4,127
I ordered small size but waist part is little bit loose for me. I can put my fist in between. I normally wear 26 inch-pants and small size of gym leggings from other brands.,4,173
So soft love them love them,4,27
Ordered all 4 colors in a medium for golf tournament. Runs a little short but perfect for what we needed,4,104
Great for many occasions.,4,25
Have XXL size,4,13
This was a gift! It was a great deal and the shipping was super fast!<br />The box and the bulk cellophane wrap it came in were chintzy though...<br />But - I definitely can’t complain... the quality and speed for the super low price was worth the re-wrap! Lol!,4,261
"I ordered 1 size large than in a store. I should have ordered 2 sizes bigger, but a little more healthy eating should help it fit a little more loose in the middle.",4,164
Muy cómodo y fresco,4,19
3 pockets on the back of the shirt with a reflective clip. The thin fabric is ideal for keeping cool and cooling off when you stop. Comfortable against my skin. Wash and wear. Fit as expected.  If it falls apart after a dozen washes I will report back.,4,252
"I normally wear a medium, but I read the reviews and they said that it ran a small so I ordered a large, well now its too big, and I don't really want to wear it. A medium would have been perfect. Oh well!",4,205
Is a little bug but the girls can grow into it but nice soft cool material.,4,75
They  are good.,4,15
I was impressed with how quickly they were delivered. I also loved the quality for the price. The only thing is they were a little larger than I was expecting.,4,159
I needed an attire for work.  It went well with my suede boots.  I bought for my business trip to Michigan I dont believe this will be warm enough but it's comfortable and nice enough for Georgia climate.,4,204
the pants was a little thin but i loved it,4,42
"Pros: A practical clock.<br />  Lightweight and visually very pleasant for daily.<br />  Good finishing and quality of material for the price<br /><br />Con: The hands of the clock could contrast more to facilitate the visualization of the hours (red on red...),",4,262
"The gold one came damaged, that was disappointing because it was the one I was most excited for.  The others are incredibly good quality though, so even with just the 5, this was an absolute steal of a purchase.",4,211
"Would be 5 stars but the strap already broke on me, aside from that they look great and don't fog up on the slopes. All my friends thought they were high end goggles.",4,166
They are a little larger than expected.,4,39
The product quality is good but the yellow coloring was much paler than I had expected . I thought it was gonna be an actual shade of yellow but it looks more like a pale tan. Just a heads up .,4,193
Quality you'd expect for price but honestly unless you inspect closely it looks lovely enough for my daughter to wear in our Ireland wedding.,4,141
"Cute. My daughter wanted to look like one of these ""guys"" so it was perfect...except for the ""ears"" at the top. Not sure what thats about.",4,138
I like the size of the earrings.,4,32
The sunglasses look really nice and is block the sun and light from hurting your eyes. But it’s only for people with smaller head shapes because they wouldn’t fit me. But they fit my dad nicely👍🏼,4,195
"I Liked them just the only problem with the two pair I bought was the rear was a bit low in both pairs. Great price for both, just over $35.",4,140
The hoops are larger than I needed so I had to cut them. I have a rather large nose so I was suprised the didn't fit. I ordeed these along time ago and have one of them in now. Have had it in for months with no problems.,4,220
"Super cute, soft material- just runs a little small so I would size up next time 🥰",4,82
"I have used them and they are ok. Of course they do what they are supposse to do. They fit my head, they are comfortable, they keep my ears warm but  they move from my head if i am doing any activity, the color i received is blue. i wanted them to be black.",4,257
I pair has loose stitching otherwise just as advertised.,4,56
I used the mask for my sons wedding . The 3 pack was great i was able to match my dress perfectly,4,97
I love the picture with the two owls I just wish it was a little bigger and the price is good too.,4,98
Very nice but very big for an average four year old.,4,52
Comfy to wear and cute,4,22
These are really beautiful!,4,27
It's perfect!!,4,14
"I really love it. Soo stylish, and big enough on the inside.<br />My only problem is.. I ordered a pink one",4,107
"The dress is really nice, the fabric is a little thin but for the price I think is ok, it runs big!",4,99
My daughter wore these 2 short  times around the house before our wedding (Which they were bought for).  The glitter wore off the toes and the flower on top came unraveled.  They are adorable but not very durable.  I would suggest if you are buying them for an occasion dont use them before hand.,4,296
"It is a nice top, I just wish I had sized up.",4,45
I did not receive the spatula,4,29
"Nice thumb ring, or for whichever finger you choose.  Striking, yet simple.",4,75
Love this bag.Fits everything needed to a quick trip to the mall.,4,65
"Good hat, gloves are a little on the thin side though.",4,54
"Love the cooler overall however, the place mention of the plug in my car was a awkward and managed to break the first time I used it.",4,133
"I love the fit and quality of the dresses I purchased. They make me feel pretty, classic, romantic and so feminine!  I’ve found this shop to have the best  retro clothing I’ve ever seen!  You won’t be disappointed!",4,214
Wish sleeves were longer. Like otherwise.,4,41
Shirt lasted for the occasion but won’t last too many washes.,4,61
"Stretched too much now loose fitting,",4,37
This is a nice comfortable dress for work.  Fabric is a little thin so I'm not sure how long it will last but it works for the price.,4,133
Easy to locate my keys.,4,23
Really love this dress. I think it runs a little big though.,4,60
Love this dress! Fits great and very flattering! I'm 5'3 and 153lbs. I got a medium,4,83
It's a little larger than I expected.  I Wanted it for a 5 yr old.  I hope she will still like it.,4,98
Lots of pockets to put things in.. I do love this purse.. so glad I bought it..,4,79
Great hat but way to big for a three year old....its better for a 6-10ish year old. He will grow into it 😉,4,106
"I loved the look of this pearl necklace - the length was nice, the colors are very pretty. The delivery went smoothly but sadly had to return because of a broken bead - return also went smoothly",4,194
Its was for my Grand daughters 11th Birthday and she called right away and said I love it.,4,90
"Really beautifull watch. Beware that is a big watch. Only complaint is the band, makes noises!!!",4,96
Very nice but way too big. Had to return,4,40
Good quality material. However the stitching on the adjustable strap was not done well. Broke on first adjustment and so I had to get it repaired.,4,146
"[[VIDEOID:c1bcce8caf0dded89f34498faa616780]] They are beautiful glasses, that's the reason that I ordered another ones. Unfortunately one of them came  the nose piece off",4,170
"Its a beautiful dress  but it was somewhat too big..some customers say it runs small but I think it runs true to size..I got the size 6 but should have gotten the 4. bust 32 A, WAIST 27- 28&#34; HIP 36-38  .The only thing that was missing is the waist ribbon..I  would buy another color if there was.",4,300
"After reading reviews, I bought both a medium and a large for my small 9 year old (who wears an 8 or medium at Old Navy). The medium fits him well though I will note that the arms are on the long side for both sizes. Quality is good, happy with my purchase.",4,257
"So yeahhh....makes your booty POP! I already have a big one lol. Anyways, my boyfriend said “woah , are those new? it looks like a thong on top of pants.” LOL. I do keep having to pull them up. I’ll mostly likely only wear them around the house. Got a size medium",4,263
Small but very nice!,4,20
"Top is perfect, but bottom is too small for me.  I'm 5.2' and 110 lbs.  But might be perfect for you if you don't have loose skin like I do.  You know what I mean ladies.  Everyone's bottom is diff. shape and size.",4,214
Very pretty<br /><br />Sad I will Have to iron it but that's authentic!,4,71
Comfortable but fit smaller then I expected and wanted. I'd recommend sizing up one size but still like the shirt.,4,114
"It is kinda made cheaply. It broke the first time I wore it. I was able to fix it, but am a little disappointed with the quality. Looks nice though...added a pic of the bracelet with (with another one I own).",4,208
"The bill is a bit longer than I thought, but it's still a lovely hat. Makes me feel sassy haha. I always get compliments on it, I love it!",4,138
My daughter loves stitch. This was a Good Christmas present,4,59
This is an awesome dress. I purchased two for a vacation this summer. They are wrinkle resistant and light weight. You can dress them up or down with a pair sneakers. Glad I found them.,4,185
"I love it ,my daughter is so happy",4,34
"This shirt looked and fit nice at first. After a few washes, it pilled a little. I didnt pay much for it so I still think it's worth it but I no longer wear this as a dressy shirt.",4,180
The shoulders are a bit small so it doesn't go off the shoulders well and the rest is a bit baggy. It is a nice shirt though and is very comfortable and I am pleased with it.,4,174
"I got the burgundy. It’s cute, not see through, and the print is as pictured.",4,77
Nice quality and fit!,4,21
Good fit and nice,4,17
"Very convenient  use, but not the best quality item",4,51
The caps are nicely made but more of a silk material which moves around a bit on your head.  They are too big for my head but tie in the back but this makes the buttons too far back for my mask loops. Still they work for what I needed,4,234
Work great but they weren't quit deep enough for for my frames ; but I'm happy with them all in all .,4,101
Tanks run small. But cute,4,25
Very light weight. Comfortable and loose,4,40
"Not long at all barely reaches the top of my pants, and fits big around the middle",4,82
Buy this for summer fun.,4,24
I have a Luau housewarming party to attend and all guest are asked to wear Hawaiian themed outfits and I got these lays because they are unique in color and not the typical rainbow colored ones in every store that every person will be wearing.,4,243
"My feet have been cold my whole life. These really help and they are thin enough to wear another pair of socks over them, which I do. Still able to wear all my shoes without having to wear thick boot socks.",4,206
"Very glad I listened to others and ordered on size up.  In my case, an XXL fit like a normal xl.  This is stretchy, &#34;under armour&#34; style material, although a bit thicker.",4,178
Only a little hard to pull up yet the size was correct,4,54
Seems to be doing a good job drying and deodorizing. My shoes are a size 9. These wouldn't fit anything smaller.,4,112
"Super cute, but they run big so I would size down and the shipping took forever to get them",4,91
"These are pretty nice earrings.  I think it is important to note that the earring has a screwback, and also the jewel part screws off too.  For this reason, I thought I got a broken product.  But I realized that there are three separate pieces.",4,244
Fits great. Little longer than expected,4,39
"They all came individually wrapped, there’s one pack of studs and two packs of L hooks.<br />The studs stem is short, so it doesn’t poke out very far on the inside of your nose.",4,177
Very nice.  Quick delivery,4,26
Thinner material than expected but otherwise as described.,4,58
These are good but I do wish they were a little smaller!  They are great to use.,4,80
Not as big as I thought it was going to be. Sleeves and lenghth are a perfect size.love the pockets,4,99
"Cute dress, but it was just not the right shape for my body. It on the hunt to find something similar!",4,102
I seen this Ear ring and loved it.  The back of the ring (dragon tail) is a little looser than I would like but still stays on just fine. all in all I like what I got and for half the price of others.  It is awesome.,4,216
There were no instructions so one of them was hard to figure out how to use.  Other than that it was  nice product.,4,115
I prefer hat with top zipped out.  It shades most of my face and is very light.,4,79
Cómodas,4,7
"This dress is extremely comfortable and cute , I’m lacking a bit in the chest area so that’s the only place where the fit is a little weird but nothing that a good push up bra can’t fix ! Def runs a bit small so order a size up",4,227
"These are cute and fit nice, ride a little but sexy",4,51
"they were a touch scratched but other than that, exactly as pictured.",4,69
Love this little dress! I knew it was a thin stretchy dress but it was sooo long and I’m 5’11!! It was past my knees! However I had it hemmed and wore it for Christmas!,4,168
For what I was looking for it works well.  For me personally I wish they were a little longer (wider) to have more facial coverage,4,130
The shirts itself were really cute but the wrong date was placed on it and mixed with a different shirt just be sure to check and recheck your order,4,148
I normally wear a large and base on some reviews I got ex-large and glad I did,4,78
"I'm 5'9"" and 170 lbs - large was massive in chest and flowy from waist down. Exchanging for a medium. Nice quality of fabric and soft!",4,134
"Overall, these were cute but came with one set of the earrings that were broken. Not really worth the time to send it back. Still pretty good for the price since there were several others in this set that were good.",4,215
"Feel great, reason for 4 stars one has a click hoping it will stop.",4,67
A gift for my granddaughter.  She chose it.  It was exactly as presented and she was very happy/pricing a plus too.  Only thing to keep in mind is that it is shipped from out of the states so if you want it quickly don't make the purchase.,4,239
Great value for the quality of material and stylish,4,51
Bought a 2x was a little too big but it’s beautiful on,4,54
"Thought it was going to be more of a summer dress but ended up being a nighty because of the material. It's super comfy, but a little too short.",4,144
My grandson normally wears the size I ordered.  These shoes were so narrow that the strap would reach across to attach and close on the other side.<br />Returned the shoes.,4,172
Looks exactly as it does on the computer.,4,41
"These are lovely clip earrings, even comfortable, I returned them though,  because I’m still looking for larger (2 1/2 cm at the back) dome earrings. Anyone looking for very small earrings  would love these ones",4,211
Like the style of the bra. Though I usually am a small and so I ordered a small. The plastic part on the strap though digs into me even with the straps loose,4,157
"This a beautiful but heavy bag.  Even with nothing in it, it weighs quite a bit.",4,80
"great vibrant color.  can be dressed up or dressed down. drawstring in the middle is actually a drawstring and not JUST for show. i am 5'3"" 140lb ordered a medium",4,162
And unusual (which I like) but heavy,4,36
Very easy to slip on my feet.,4,29
"Great fit, cute and great price!",4,32
pretty but lightweight,4,22
"Really cute bikini, just not the cut for me. I have a small chest and felt like the top just wasn't quite right.<br />Material feels quality.",4,141
Nice bra...runs a little small...order a size larger.,4,53
PROS:<br />Material is thick and durable.<br />The rim can flip up so baby's face is more visible.<br /><br />CONS:<br />No chin strap to keep my son from taking it off.,4,169
Love them however I only received 11 pairs. Had to take away 1 star,4,67
"Love the color, Love the fit of the dress, but the sleeves were a little tight.",4,79
I wore these for a 13 hour road trip. They were extremely comfortable amd soft however I was disappointed because they didn't provide coverage around the ankle. Overall I like the way they feel and the ease of putting them on.,4,226
little larger than expected but great,4,37
Everything was great and good quality except for the tablecloth: it was very thin and flimsy and tore very easily.,4,114
"The shirt fits me well, im 5’7”, 220 lb, 42DD and I bought an xl, but the material is a stretchy cotton and it’s much shorter than the picture. Definitely size up to account for shrinking. Cute though, I will keep it.",4,217
Cute shoes.  Comfortable heel.  Upper strap rubs on the ankle a bit.,4,68
"I really liked the animal print so much I overlooked the fact that the zipper is in the front. I'm okay with it I guess, I'm just used to side or back zip skirts... I'll have to see if I warm up to it more over time. Everything else is more than satisfactory.",4,259
Super cute on.,4,14
This fits me more like a dress. I am going to purchase a smaller one for a more shirt like fit.,4,95
Really nice I liked good price and quality,4,42
Love all the colors but it is hard to get the ball back on when you put it in the piercing,4,90
All OK. Thank You!,4,18
Fits fine. Works fine.,4,22
"This little keychain has worked well.  The only issue was after several drops (which I seem to do frequently), the emblem piece fell off.  I was lucky to catch it and after a little gorilla glue it is back to good as new.",4,221
Love the dress. Exactly as shown. The bow on back was a little bit off....not in the middle as expected.,4,104
"Solid materials for these glasses.  Very good lenses.  One minor ding I have to give is that they do pop up off the bridge of my nose with little provocation, so positioning them when wearing them is key (for me).",4,213
"Longer than pictured. Very busy pattern but I love turquoise. Great fabric, actually linen and cotton.",4,102
These are great for motocross they grip very well.The only reason they get a 4 star is because of the price 😂,4,109
This product comes vaccum sealed in the bag and requires a wash to puff and take out the plethora of wrinkles. Other thank that it's a cute and very light coat. It's not as puffy and full as the photo let's on. This coat will not keep to warm it's just a fashion item. The hardware is cute.,4,290
"Quite heavy, but works for me<br /><br />I bought it the second time in July 2017 :)",4,84
"It came faster than I expected, they look the same as in the picture and they did fit! Although you have to be careful in case the paint chips off if it gets scratched. But if you're careful it wont. Also, they are glossy, and not matte. But overall they're alright.",4,266
"This bra was made of good quality material, however it was not what I wanted. It has hook and eyes as well as zipper front",4,122
The person I got the ring for really likes it.,4,46
"The material is super soft. I didn’t give it 5 stars because the bottom of the romper doesn’t have an opening; it is enclosed with a zipper on the inside, but cannot be opened.",4,176
I think it's so useful.,4,23
"Cute silver earrings, very basic but serve their purpose.<br />The backings holes are a little small when attempting to attach at first, I just used the largest balled earrings to remedy this issue by widening the holes and they work wonderfully now .",4,251
"It is just as described, I am recently retired after many years as a  RN, and wore this as a necklace and got many compliments.  Thank you",4,138
A gift for someone who loved it.,4,32
"They were a gift, they lovedit",4,30
I wore it for a month and then it broke! The whole top part with the stone broke off. Not repairable. So bummed.,4,112
This was a beautiful anklet I showered with it etc but once it hit the pool the anklet turned black :( I was able to clean it with toothpaste and it looks brand new again,4,170
Nice and warm. Like wearing a robe. Not warm enough for winter outer wear.,4,74
"these shoes are definitely a bright red, and they are great so far just still a little bit to big. need a little breaking in.",4,125
"Good thick leather watchband, a bit pricey",4,42
Fit well at first very comfortable they do tend to ride up though the day,4,73
"Super cute and comfortable. It's a little loose around the waist for me, but the length is perfect to the knees and covers my backside without having to worry.",4,159
"Cute and not tacky, just the right sparkle to dress up a black dress.  They are heavy so I bought those earring backs that stabilize heavy earrings...which I found super cheap on Amazon.",4,186
"It's a great design and functions perfectly. It's pretty too, but I expect a better paint quality at that price. Perhaps another color holds up better or the paint chips wouldn't be as noticeable?",4,196
Cute design and decent fabric but sized for a elephant head.  I cut and re-sewed to fit. They are priced lower for a reason.  Still worth $4.,4,141
These are really pretty and it's very hard to find earrings that dangle like this for non-pierced ears.  I really like them.,4,124
Nice quality for price - my grown son has them in his car...,4,60
Decent quality but just a smidge short.  But still a good buy.,4,62
"Looks gorgeous on, and fits according to their measurement guide.",4,65
very cute keychain  for Van lovers,4,34
"Look & fit as advertised. Let kids play thru this winter & ask again. For the price, even if after year......Still dry & warm - a success.",4,138
Love it and my son wears this to school. Comfortable and fits perfectly. He's 6. The ears are stretched out now but that comes with wearing it daily.,4,149
Love the fabric Love the Look because I will shirts under it Wish I would have ordered up 1 size because I like jackets roomier not tight But will order more in 1 size up and multiple colors. LOVE!,4,197
"Love them! Fast shipping as well. One review mentioned it wouldn't fit for like kid size which I also wish they had, is more adjustable because Mine is just a bit big for my wrist. Other than that, they are great! thanks!:)",4,223
"Cute, fun masks that fit properly, however, they are way too thick, even without the filters.",4,93
ITS VERY CUTE BUT IT RUNS REALLY BIG,4,36
"I was looking for a funky purse, and this certainly fits the bill.  I just wish it had more zippers and compartments inside.  Things can really get lost in there.",4,162
"I like the print. It’s indigo, right.  The only thing I don’t like is the way the pockets are made on each side.",4,112
"It has a different 'look' then my other bathing suits, I will need to 'take up' a little material just under arm pit, it gathers there just a little.  But with that small 'fix' I really like the suit.",4,200
"They're very nice looking, it come with a pouch and a little metal box, nice package, the Earrings are very shiny, nice size not to small not to big, so I am happy",4,163
Bought this shirt and a equivalent Dickies.  $6.00 difference.  The Woolrich cotton is softer to the feel. I would rather have the Woolrich.,4,140
Supper comfy and fits week. It a bit thin though and see through in the sun.,4,76
Comfortable. Wear nicely. Looking forward to less tired eyes.,4,61
Pretty good face mask. Doesn't slide easy to breath through.,4,60
"One broke the first day, but for the cost it was worth the other 2",4,66
It look like an expensive watch but that is not the reason I bought this watch. It feel good on my wrist. Working correctly is all I wanted. Good watch for this price,4,166
"Really nice dress, I’m 5’9 and it covered my feet which is what I wanted, it is see-through.",4,92
"I have a smaller top half and wider hips. 5'8"" 138 lbs. 36/30/40. I ordered the medium. It barely fits my hips. Will need a slick thin material spanx type under dress. I typically wear a 4/6.",4,191
I recomended! High quality dress material. Just keep look on the size. Use 1 size larger.,4,89
wish it can with two one for each ear,4,37
neat wear around the house dress,4,32
Jackets amazing but the zipper is kinda cheap and gets stuck alot.,4,66
This was purchased for a work place giveaway. I just want this review reminder to go away,4,89
Nice cotton hat but for the money I expected it to be crisper looking  Wrinkled mess,4,84
Very  Sheer  but  soft  and  comfortable,4,40
Good shoes and as expected good quality!,4,40
Need to install near hinge as it tends to slip off Temples near end.,4,68
"Not as big as I expected. Nice shade blue and built material. I even got a small extra gift, a coin purse.",4,106
"Fabric feels nice, light and soft. Thought it would be longer, but the color is nice.",4,85
They are cute straps. I just wished they had more characters. I clicked all characters and they all showed Jung Kook.<br />My daughter is fan of J Hope.,4,152
"Good quality wallet. A little tight for my cards, etc.",4,54
"I like it but it's very tight, I'm 5 foot 1 in wear a size 7 pant and have a longer torso so it's a little awkard in the crotch area",4,132
These are cute earrings but the curved ones are very difficult to get in. My nose is a bit bigger than most- possibly b/c I'm black but the straight earrings were too short. The L shaped ones worked best.,4,204
Very well made and sweet. Very worth the cost.,4,46
Soft - nice material and style. Great to accessorize!,4,53
Beautiful earings!''',4,21
"They were a little baggier than I liked, but perhaps just fit a little differently on me.  Overall not a bad pair of sweats.",4,124
Very pretty! If you are purchasing as a gift. Know these only come in a small zip top bag. You may want to plan for a box. Otherwise very nice.,4,143
Too much hole which is the design of itself. Buy a fleece or padding instead if you want to be saved from colf<br />d.,4,118
Nice but not that warm,4,22
"These ankle boots fit me except for the ankles.  Therefore, the zippers are somewhat difficult to zip up on the outside of the ankles.  I like the boots very much.  I would recommend these for someone who likes a low heel with an outside zipper.",4,245
This is an awesome jacket. Nice quality felt really good. Only bad side was that it was too small.,4,98
"Good ,,",4,7
The lenses are a little small but I expected that.  They work great and love the metal case.  Am guessing the clip won't hold up long but so far its fine.,4,154
"Bought for my daughter for Christmas so she has not worn, but it looks as advertised. The graphics are more of an iron on feel.",4,127
More color options needed and the laces are not necessary the shoes stays on quite well.,4,88
My husband loves this watch but cant set the date. Instructions would be helpful. Fits a smaller wrist.,4,103
"Loved the look of this dress, but it was super sheer.  Had to make sure there was a slip on underneath.  Material was very wrinkly.  Had to have it pressed before wear, simple run through the dryer didn’t get all the wrinkles out.",4,230
This is cute even for larger  Women,4,35
"love the fabric, color and sleeve length. ordered a medium thinking it was an over size tee, but it's too small for my liking.",4,126
"This is a cute necklace. It isn't the most elegant, but it is pretty and could probably be jazzed up a bit. Overall though, it is a nice piece and would be a good stocking stuffer.",4,180
Great fit and have worked nicely.,4,33
I live in Maine and hike regularly. This hat works well. The only drawback is driving with it on; the puffball hits the back of my seat.,4,136
"Soft, light and beautiful.  Wish the arm straps were a bit longer to fit over a winter coat sleeve, but otherwise it's great.  Lots of compliments.",4,147
Very fluffy and soft.,4,21
Not fancy but functional! Durable for frequent washing and comfortable! Cotton cooler in the hot summer weather. Good buy!,4,122
fits well and looks great,4,25
Good Buy,4,8
I like this shoes. They are very comfortable,4,44
LIKED THE PICTURE,4,17
"Everything about the item was ok so far. My husband still has to try them, though. I'm smaller than him a bit, I tried them on and they fit somewhat a little snug. ESPECIALLY in the thigh and butt areas.",4,203
"Nice Bag, though I sent it back, not big enough for my bible...",4,63
"Simple and sophisticated.<br /><br />The mask is better than I thought it would be for the price.  It is elegant enough for any level (formal or informal) of costume ball, and it doesn't scream &#34;look at this gaudy thing&#34;.<br /><br />Very nice.",4,251
There Ok.,4,9
"I've gotten some compliments on my ""beautiful"" mask, but I've also found it to be quite comfortable and not as steamy on my glasses as some masks.",4,146
Was very weary about ordering this but it turned out great! The bottoms are a tad small but the top fit perfectly! I was pleased with this product!,4,147
A very nice Summer robe.  A bit thin for a Midwest Winter.,4,58
"Soft doesn’t rub wrist, basic color",4,35
Very snug and warm,4,18
The dress runs a little longer than expected.,4,45
"Great price for what was included! I use the larger bag to carry my books and the next size down to carry my personal effects. What makes it great is if I need something smaller for a night out, I can.",4,201
Great fit. Washes well. Great quality!,4,38
The molding is kinda bulky but it's a great product fir 8$. The bottom fits perfect but the top makes my mouth look swollen.,4,124
Shirt is a bit small for 2t,4,27
This is a cute and comfortable dress sock. I like to wear these at work in the winter with my dress pants and boots or close toed shoes. they fit as expected and the design is cute.,4,181
I like the shirt.  Just got it for wearing around the house or out camping.  If I order again I’ll order a size larger (a 2X)I usually wear an XL. This one ran on the small side.,4,178
Fit was a bit longer than expected but great for the price,4,58
"The lens scratch easily, other than that I love them",4,52
Beautiful watch for the price.,4,30
So soft!!!! Love this. Ordered a second one,4,43
Very nice! Used it for my Rosita cosplay and when I made the ponytails you did not see the lace or seams underneath. This is my second purchase from Simplicity and I would buy again.,4,182
Cool but not tied to the body while swimming and unfortunately the cool print started to peel off,4,97
just a little darker than I thought they would be.  I would have prefered a lighter lense.,4,90
Beautiful dress this dress runs long  I really enjoyed that because I’m 5’11”.,4,78
"It is beautiful and fit well, but there are some threads out of the buttons, which may not be of a high quality.",4,112
cosy and casual,4,15
These are OK for the price.  But be aware they are not for small heads.  They are big on me and I’m not petite.,4,111
"Like the material, very breathable and fits perfectly",4,53
"Fits well but I wish it was stretchy. Other than that, it looks good and build quality seems good, so far.",4,106
Not as pretty as shown but still pretty,4,39
I wish there were more pairs but still appreciate them.,4,55
"Very cute, cozy and kept my feet warm. I would say these may be a little pricey for one pair however good quality. and i love the sort of matching yet mismatching designs.",4,171
"Great value! The egg is fantastic-will fit men, women & youth. The bacon is more constricting and a tad bit scratchy since it is worn around the face.  But over all  very good at this price point.",4,196
Purchased this for my wife.  She has been very happy with the purchase.,4,71
"Good buy for the price. I like the matte finish and the spring temples. The glasses are also super durable, I have rolled on them and dropped them and they're still going strong.",4,178
Great price for a good dress. I attend a function every year with the same people and I like to have a new dress every time. I don't want to spend a lot and this was perfect. The material is not the best quality but for $19 It was great.,4,237
They could be brighter Red.  In dim light they look black,4,57
Nice hat. Just like the picture.,4,32
LOVE it kinda on the small side but great quality shirt,4,55
"I am in total agreement with all of the posted reveiws.I ordered 1 size up (2xl) and the shirt fits great and is an awesome design but it is definitely off on the color and definitely a lightweight t-shirt.I personally think this shirt is the coolest design of all on pepsistuff,,but you know...",4,295
"We did finally get the product. I love sailor moon and the hat looks great, but im not sure how long the sailor moon emblem will last as it's kind of an iron on thing.",4,167
"Good pants, but do fit a little small.",4,38
"Very beautiful dress, loved everything about it, only thing was that I ordered a Medium and it fit a little loose. I then ordered the small and it fit perfect.<br />Super comfortable to wear.",4,191
"seriously need to add a XS/S option<br />the S/M are seriously huge on me, and I'm only 5'2&#34;<br />Other than being too big, they are soft and comfy but the waist is very loose and they fall down because there's nothing to hold them up",4,238
This is a great looking watch. The world timer is a little hard to see but I am sure it you were traveling then it would help greatly of it you need to know the time in another country for business.<br />I love this watch.,4,222
They’re super cheap and will do the job when needed. I’m under no illusion of these being a multi-use or any thicker than they are being as they’re marketed as disposable. I’d buy it again,4,188
I love the bows but it's tight for my 2month old head. I didn't get a chance to let her wear it.,4,96
What a cute summer jumpsuit. I love the style and colors (I ordered the blue). I ordered according to the description and the size was just right.,4,146
Order your normal size regardless of what the description says. I ordered one size up as recommended and they’re way too big,4,124
alittle big,4,11
I would like to see this made with a cotton fabric. The pajamas are cute and they will like them.,4,97
Awesome product... but for something that you use for the bottom of your shoe to hold your pant legs from riding up during a bike ride and that will eventually need to be replace.. I feel it's a bit too pricey!!!😕,4,213
"I LOVE this skirt! It makes me feel like a princess. It is a little long, but I am a short gal so I made sure to size down since the elastic is stretchy and I’m glad I did. This color is see through so you’ll have to wear a slip underneath. I’m 5’ 2” with a curvy build and got a small.",4,286
a nice pair of cargo shorts that were delivered on time.,4,56
Just about perfct!!!,4,20
"Beautiful, but be aware that it's small.  I have small wrists and this fit so tightly that it was uncomfortable.  Wish it was bigger.  Beautiful though.  When I did wear it, I received many compliments.",4,202
"I'm 5'6&#34; and a bit heavy in the mid section at 160#. The large was a bit bigger than expected and extremely loose in the ankle. That being said, they are exceptionally soft and comfy! I plan to keep them for lounging around or wearing with tall boots so no one will see the gap in the ankles.",4,296
"I don't know how but I received black, 2-7 inch, 1-71/2 inch and 1-8 inch<br />Then received  1-8 in ch white. Go figure. H",4,123
"It was a gift and even though I order the small, it was slightly large for the person; however, she liked it that size and has enjoyed using it so I say it was a good purchase.",4,176
It’s a really cute anklet It was just a little small and kind of cut into my skin,4,81
I really like how well made this top is. It is comfortable. But it runs really small. I usually wear a medium but needed an XL in this.,4,135
expected a thicker material but its good,4,40
"Fits a little more snug than I would have liked, but it is very comfortable. More of a performance-type fabric",4,110
"I’m 5’8 and these were short on me... maybe two or three inches off the floor. I might try to pull them off as a cropped look, but not sure if that will work. Otherwise they’re very cute.",4,187
"It's a good product,  just the per6size and it also hides your personal information so not everyone can see it .",4,112
"Muy bonita, corre pequeña soy m y Cómpre una L para que me quede... L y tengo 130 libras",4,88
"GOOD BUY,  I'LL BE BACK",4,23
"Fit was good, print is good, but order early if it's a gift!",4,60
"J should have ordered small, but they're not too large to use. I like them a lot and they cushion my hands quite well.",4,118
"The battery packs don’t want to stay in place, the head and neck are hard to keep inflated but overall I was pleased with the quality.",4,134
Muy pequeno,4,11
"Though it could be smaller for me, 5'3"", I was able to adjust it to fit pretty well. It's supple and not too heavy. The pockets are very handy. I use it, mostly seated, to solder jewelry and it protects my clothes and lap from the occasional piece of dropped metal or  hot tweezers.",4,282
"Very comfortable for around the house, or even with jeans to the store. If fit just a bit too big before washing, and after one wash it does not even reach the belt line. Also if you have average to long arms the sleeves will be to short.",4,238
A little wide around the head but comfortable,4,45
"This piece is beautiful, but runs very small.  I wear a large and can't even get this over my shoulders.  Great for any wardrobe, just beware of the fit.  It runs VERY small.",4,174
"It could have been a little longer, but overall, very good.",4,59
Sturdy and last a whole lot longer than the cheap ones at walmart.,4,66
Love it . Fits great,4,20
"They work well, they fit well and do the job, but just be mindful that they are for under skirts/dresses, NOT bicycle shorts. They are rather thin.",4,147
"Love love it. Got so many compliments. Wish I could have bought a bigger size. The material used isn’t too good. I would use it for 2-3 wears, it might rip soon. They should lower the price for fabric used.",4,206
There really cute,4,17
Really liked this product. The one thing I will say about the fabric is that it makes u swear so wear them on a cool day,4,120
"It doesn't take a beating well but it's an all right bag for the price. Do not give this bag to anyone who is determined to carry their house with them, as the zippers will not withstand the burden.",4,198
Arrived quickly and in good shape. It fits securely on the head and is very cute! Looking forward to wearing it on my next beach trip.,4,134
"Nice looking watch winder, Compact for 1 watch.  Space is too tight for a large dace watch 45mm.  Runs with AC or battery.  Black Metal",4,135
"I got the dress in a size S and it fits great,but the arm holes are too big/long. So I had to sew the straps up a lil to have it fit better.",4,140
Fits as expected<br /> Feels nice.,4,34
"Very cute but thin material, must wear a slip underneath",4,56
"Good quality, but runs large. All three sizes I bought were one to two sizes bigger than the kids normal shoes (with same size as listed)!",4,138
Cute. Runs small.,4,17
This is very pretty,4,19
I love the design! It's bright and hasn't faded! The only flaw that I noticed was that it was a bit rounder than I had expected. It fits a bit awkwardly on my head but it's still cute!,4,184
"Soft, comfortable, and fits as expected. Happy with my purchase!",4,64
Useful for hot days.,4,20
My son loves these.  Just know that there is next to no arch support.,4,69
Bought mine a couple of years ago and these things are STILL tough. I love them!!,4,81
"Very soft and drapey, but could use a couple of waist-defining darts on the back at the waist.",4,94
excellent compression.  good comfort,4,36
"Great necklace so far, but the opening is very small and hard to get the cremains in even using the funnel.",4,107
Came as expected. Dries decently quick. Good for gym shower floors. Wish it came with a carrying bag.,4,101
IMO this is g shock s  best looking watch. Stunning charcoal grey band and 12 sided case w cherry ip plating. That said there is no digi part therefore you will not have some of g shocks function. But it is lite and beautiful.,4,226
I love these really easy to put on my daughter. She looked super cute with them on,4,82
Thsy were a little bit larger than expected but they are extremely comfortable.,4,79
Would be lovely if they offered short sizes. I had to alter these after buying them because they were for tall people only.,4,123
Fits very well but pulls up alittle at times.,4,45
"I like the apron, it isn’t very thick and is pretty thin. It’s also pretty small so not sure how long it will last for my 3yo but will fit perfect right now.",4,157
I love this luggage set.  It is very easy to move around and an easy find on the conveyor belt when you are tired from traveling.  The only con is that because of the color the scuffs and scratches show up pretty easily but I was able to wipe most of them off with ease.  I recommend this luggage!,4,297
Love the watch. It is difficult to take links out to adjust to wrist size.,4,74
Run a little on the small side. Otherwise great comfy tanks.,4,60
"The sock is largely invisible, but does bunch some at my ankle.",4,63
Super flirty. Very thin material though. I don't see it lasting long but it's very cute. Would buy other colors.,4,112
"Love the pockets on this dress. Dress is a loose fit. Fabric claims to be 95% cotton, certainly feel more synthetic vs cotton. Feels cool on skin.",4,146
"Little big , and the color was more like a baby food looking color yellowish, biegish, other than that I like the shirt , has a nice look , and the fabric is nice and cool to the skin ,",4,185
Beautiful suit. Bottoms a little smaller than I expected but great colors!,4,74
"My son had wanted this for Halloween, but also likes to wear as PJs.",4,68
Loved it .. i bought it so i can wear it at the beach and take lots of good fun photos! .. it comes with a fabric case to protect,4,129
"If you know earring sizes well then you’ll already know this, only the biggest size fit where my piercing was. It’s tricky to put on but worth it for the price.",4,160
"Fit true to size, beautiful",4,27
fits larger than expected but it is comfortable and adequate support for running,4,80
Nice but has some pilling now.,4,30
"These earrings are unique and could put them on  with little effort but for me, the globe part does not show enough from the back, however, I have large ears and this could be the problem.  Quality is good  and arrived in good time.....price was hard to beat.",4,259
Looks good and fits well. Top is not the style shown in the picture but still looks good.,4,89
"I love buckling method. The buckle is a little larger than I expected, and it's a little heavier than I expected. But it works OK",4,129
Fair purchase,4,13
great product. did not have instruction with though,4,51
"I like it, but it fits smaller than my other Miusol dresses. The skirt is very tight, wish I would have ordered a different size though.",4,136
"This sweatshirt is exactly what I expected. It fits perfect, is made of good quality fabric and the design is beautiful just as in the picture.  I bought this a s a gift and was very satisfied.",4,193
This is a beautiful bag. It's a lovely color with roomy compartments and large enough to carry everything I need to take. I think it is ideal!,4,142
"Got it for a 7-year old. Works great, lots of different colors to try. 11-year old brother wants a pair now. Great price!",4,121
"Fits my 2 year old with plenty of room to grow.  While he doesn't enjoy wearing them, he can tolerate them so he can cut grass with dad.",4,136
Awesome fit and looks great!!!,4,30
great colors and i think these will last very well.,4,51
I had a top in mind when I bought this skirt. The top from another mfg. looks good with this skirt. I like to wear the skirt with a crinoline to keep it looking full. Your tastes may differ.,4,190
"Nice holds a Lot!! . Mine smelled bad, plastic and mold sent to it. No mold in it of course, just stinky. A friend bought it from me and sprayed it down with fabreeze. She's happy with it.",4,188
"Nug.... If you wear a large, get a xl but other than that, very warm",4,68
"My son loves everything CAMO, we were very happy to find a good umbrella he liked and was small enough to toss in his back pack !! Small defect on our first order but they were very quick to ship out a replacement no questions asked.<br />Good product and excellent customer service !!",4,285
Love this necklace but the chain broke when I was trying to put it on.  I was able to use another chain that I had. But the pendant is perfect!,4,143
"They were pretty. But, seem to be a little darker than the picture.",4,67
"Great little tank.  I love the studded mushroom, and it fits well (i'm a medium and ordered a medium).",4,102
"Love the sweater, but the size large, is LARGE!!",4,48
Got this for my wife she said it was very fashionable but hard to wear in a quiet office setting because of the noise it makes  banging on things .,4,147
"My 5 year old loves this costume, of course, but the material isn't great and it came super wrinkled and bunched up. The tulle(?) overlay was hard to get straightened out because it was so wrinkled. We also used different wings with the costume. The ones that come with it are pretty cheap.",4,290
I received wonderful colors expect for one. Which isn't awful because that color was too small and was a challenge to roll on.  Actually all the sizes kind of varied but they all still rolled on and fit fine.  Totally worth it for the price.,4,241
"It’s alright, fits the watch fits the wrist. Might wanna get a screen protector with it to actually protect the screen",4,118
"I love this sweater! I wore it as a dress, and then with jeans , and long boots.",4,80
They work great! They really do the only down side is they pinch the nose and hurt after 6hrs.,4,94
These glasses are fun to wear! I almost always get compliments and they came almost in perfect shape (meaning the frames were almost perfectly straight).,4,153
It was beautiful !,4,18
"Runs a bit snug, but cute overall",4,33
"Waist fits fine, just were a little bit long. GREAT product.",4,60
"This dress is lovely but runs very large. It does shrink a size in the wash, but even then is quite large. I am 5’3” and around 135 lbs. I purchased the medium after reading about the shrinking. It was a tent! After washing it is much better, but still a very loose fit.",4,270
I like this jacket fits and looks nice.,4,39
"I bought an XL as a gift. As soon as I looked at it, I knew it wouldn't fit. I tried it on, I wear a medium, and the XL is a perfect fit. It looks good on me, but I have to find something else for the gift.",4,206
It is super comfy not you have to keep pulling it back up,4,57
Cute bucket hat. I only give it 4 stars and not 5 because it’s kinda cheaply made a little bit.. it’s not a big deal because you can’t really tell but the inside of the hat kinda gives it away.. it’s cute though so I don’t regret the purchase.,4,243
is ok for newborn baby,4,22
Nice dress. Fits nicely. It's just a little more sheer than I had hoped. But I bought a slip and it works. Very light a flowy.,4,126
I ordered the 7.5 (I’m usually a 7-7.5) and was surprised by the tight fit. I would recommend sizing up. They’re super cute and comfortable otherwise and I’m happy with my purchase!,4,181
I use it mainly for sun protection.  It is a mesh style fabric so it breathes well but may not be ideal for virus and dust protection.  You can fold and double it up for better protection  The size is a bit on the bigger side which makes it more comfortable for me.,4,265
It's a Xmas present for my granddaughter I think it's going to keep her very warm this winter.,4,94
"I ordered this belt without exact measurements.<br />The belt is too small, but awesome to look at.<br /><br />Great product. Hopefully when I get an extra $20 I can order another one in the right size.<br /><br />Bucky wilson<br />[...]",4,237
"A lil smaller than I'd like to, but the quality its good,and they look really stylish",4,85
A very nice jacket. I gave it to our grandson for Christmas. Not the color that I asked for but didn't want to try to get a different color during Christmas shopping season.,4,173
Reliably warm and comfy snug.,4,29
So comfy and worth every penny!,4,31
"This purse is adorable and I couldn't wait to get it. Unfortunately, the tassel fell off and the purse is really stiff. I knew it was a smaller purse but there is absolutely no give with the material. So over all it is very cute but small, small, small.",4,253
really well-made pant the only thing is I fit into a 10 of the exact same style of pants and a different color but I had to get a 12in this color don't know why but I really do enjoy this pant.,4,193
Good quality and still have it in my closet years later.,4,56
Adorable glasses. Good quality lenses.  But the frames are HUGE!  A very large man might be able to wear them and keep them on his face.  I could not.,4,150
This was a good purchase. I accidentally received two of them. It was pretty good quality and I used it for awhile.,4,115
Even tho this came as a larger size than ordered it actually fits my Grandaughter so I'm not returning it afterall,4,114
Size medium says size 4,4,23
I love it!!,4,11
"Good, soft and not too tight, a little warm.",4,44
It was a gift to a friend,4,25
Met my expectations. Looks exactly as in the photo.,4,51
really like these but they are kind of big.,4,43
"I ordered based on the size chart, so hot s large.  They look great, but they are on<br /> the tight side.  If you are looking for looser fitting, comfort order a size up.",4,171
"I'm 5'8 , its short at the ankles.",4,34
Beautiful wrap nice and stretchy & they stay in place I wear a wig gripper under mines for security! The  print is just as gorgeous just not exactly like the photo!! But I will definitely be buying more!,4,203
"Casual shirt, very nice design on sleeves",4,41
"Very nice, good material. I have a long body and is was a little short on my torso. Dress it up or down. Bought the red one and it is a really nice color",4,153
The colors are beautiful.  It does run long.  It just didn't fit me through the bust and I realized I need a dress that just drops straight down and not cling to the bust area.<br />I do recommend this dress and didn't realize that it wasn't a style I could wear.,4,263
"I got mine early. Very pretty I tried them on once my ears were fine til I took them out, my ears were sore n red for a day so I probably won't wear much.",4,154
warm love them,4,14
They fall very easy and they get lost fast,4,42
"Little chest support, I would suggest ordering a size smaller then usually as the bottoms are adjustable eith ties on the side and the top will give you more support with a slightly small size but other then that its great and looks like picture!",4,246
Liked it a lot,4,14
"It's cheap and loud when the metal piece bumps together. I took the extra keychain off. Plan to use this to decorate my agenda with a cute charm; however, it was thicker and heavier than I thought.",4,197
Very pretty.  Got lot's of compliments at work.  A little shinier than I expected.,4,82
Nice belt but go 2 sizes up. Runs small.,4,40
Nice design and STAYS ON MY WRIST. Would buy again.,4,51
I think my Granddaughter will really like this unique bracelet.  it's  really one of a kind that I've seen.  Great idea..,4,121
"Super cute! However, the buckle gets scratches very easily.",4,59
I really liked the earrings. One of them was broken when I opened the package. But I glued it back together. Can't wait to wear them.,4,133
"Can't complain about Saxophone chain weak broke quickly , sent me a replacement right away but I did buy a 10k replacement .",4,124
"Keeps the afternoon sun glare out of my eyes.  Nicely made, light-weight.  Good buy with soft & hard case.",4,106
I love this shirt. Fits well and is flattering.,4,47
It serves the purpose.  Bought it for our beach condo. Good quality but the beige/brown tones were more predominate than I wanted or thought they would be. I did keep it tho.,4,174
the tops were a bit tight. otherwise ok,4,39
Plenty of space to breath and talk. Might be a little big on me. The nose wire is painful after wearing for a while. I am folding over the edge to give it more padding.,4,168
"I got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she still talks about how much she loves it, four months later. The print is clear and so cute but the material is a little thin. You can tell by touching it that it will likely rip",4,233
"The stuff does what it says, quite effectively.  How often can you say that these days.",4,87
Awesome jewellery,4,17
Can’ Beat the price for these recreational and effective sunglasses.,4,68
"i got an ugly neon pink color with rainbow animal print, womp. likely going to leave it in my lobby for someone to claim. i like the green color though, and how it’s packaged sanitarily.",4,186
"these worked out great, but I knew what I was getting into as I purchase this pant in JC Penney.  I think they are great and comfy for work.  They feel softer than a jean, but they are better than slacks.",4,204
The gripper could be a little tighter,4,37
"The only thing that could make this perfect is if it hooked/unhooked.<br />It is a &#34;slide over your head&#34; top. Otherwise, great support, coverage and attractiveness.",4,173
"I like the product in terms of breathability and size. Those seemed true to the description, but they do not pass the squat test and are a bit thin, so you can see through them.",4,177
Shirt looks good but I need smaller size,4,40
as expected.  on time delivery,4,30
"Top fitness perfectly, bottom was borderline too small. Nice quality for the price!",4,83
Love the ring but it bends to easy....,4,38
"It’s a little cheaper but I love it. I wish the flap underneath was a little longer. I’m big chested and wish it was a tad longer. Although for the price I’m Bally with it. I’m also 6 ft so the sleeves are too short, but I just push them up. That’s pretty much with all long sleeve shirts for me",4,295
"Ordered large; a bit big, but love the style, comfort and fabric. Will order again in medium!",4,93
Beautiful rose gold necklace!,4,29
"EXCEPT FOR THE SIZING ISSUE...WAY SMALL , IT IS A GREAT QUALITY SHIRT AND VERY PRETTY.  WISH IT FIT ME",4,102
Ok for the price little loose,4,29
Love bonnets and this is a nice one.,4,36
"These pants are so soft and very comfortable! I have a plumper behind so they’re a bit tight and ride down when I bend over but if I keep the drawstrings tight this minimizes the problem. If you have a flatter butt these would fit perfectly for you! If not, I would recommend going up a size.",4,292
irregular sizing,4,16
Very nice and dependable watch for the price point.  Looks more expensive than what it actually is but holds up well.,4,117
Very comfortable and easy to wash.,4,34
I really like it it fit exactly how I want it to...,4,51
Loved this outfit.  I got the largest size.  I am just over 200 lbs and fit well.,4,81
"these are a great quality, but they were just too bulky for me",4,62
"Very pretty and they go well with the dresses I purchased, but be forewarned that the crystal is bigger than expected.",4,118
This hat is a little boring but frankly I just saw it and got excited and bought it without a ton of additional thought. It is exactly as pictured!,4,147
bow tie #30,4,11
"Cute but way too big,  I don't like how the stitching makes a line directly down the front so I will not be exchanging for another size",4,135
"Cute shirt, but just a little snug/",4,35
"Most of the little grippy dots on the palms fell off within a few days, but otherwise good gloves.",4,98
"Nice watch a little bit more bulky than I thought, But It works as advertised.",4,78
"The pendant is cute, but not as shiny as I would have liked. But I like the pendant because it is different then anything else out there.",4,137
Shipped fast.. Nice looking watch...,4,36
Love love these boots. The only reason 8m not giving it a 5 star is because I went with the size recommendation and their still about 1/2 size too big. I wear 2 pair thick socks it's all good. I normally wear a 7. Bought a 6.5 could have bought a 6<br /><br />Other than that I love these boots!!!,4,297
Just a great piece to have in your closet. Make sure to wear underwear without panty lines since it's thin jogging material.,4,124
Great for the price. Baught as a gift. No complaints,4,52
Very nice ties,4,14
The cardigan sleeve is too short and tight which doesn't match the style of this dress. It's Ok for other part. It would be better to make 3/4 loose sleeve for this cardigan.,4,174
"I like that I can clip them on to my bag and not have to worry about them falling. They are vary thick. I have a large face so it works for my, and they are super dark, which is go at the beach or lake, but not for when you go sun to shade like on a trail.",4,256
"Great product and good Quality, was tiny bit small",4,50
I was excited when I received my bracelets. They are beautiful and looks like the pic.  I have gotten a lot of compliments.  It fits a female wrist perfectly but may be a little snug in a man.,4,192
Good to keep in second car.,4,27
"this product matched the discription and is functional,very good coloringit worked well in the set we were doing I was happy",4,124
Nice specs for the price and they fit me very well,4,50
Looks like the original tee I had back in the day...pleased with this shirt.,4,76
These are really cute but run small! My daughter is still between a size 1 and 2. We got her 2’s and they’re sadly too small. Definitely size up!,4,145
LOVELY BLOUSE. i HAD TO ODER XXL FOR A FIT. I USUALLY TAKE A MEDIUM TO LARGE,4,76
A good value,4,12
really dont stay up ..most likely will not be buying these socks again,4,70
This is very cute on our SUV. One thing ill complain about was the difficulty in removing the air bubbles prior to peeling the backing stick off.,4,145
"Love the stretchy ness of the fabric and it’s very comfortable, but the fit is a bit tight in the arms. Definitely go up 1 size. I got the 2XL and it fits like an xl.",4,166
"The Earrings were nice for the price. There was a problem with one of the butterfly backs, however.<br />It did not slide on as easily onto the earring stud as the other one did. It's not that big a problem, considering the cost.<br /><br />Luvtravel",4,250
"Nice run around pants . Cool in the heat , everyone has their own experience.",4,77
my size is a 10 EE  ...... had to order 12 ..... fits ok,4,56
"Great fit really warm to wear, gave some as Christmas gifts all were pleased.",4,77
"great light just what I needed.. Like the three settings on the light, magnet is great holds well.May get another one.",4,118
I like the material.Very soft and launders very well,4,52
I bought these for my three daughters for Christmas.  I have worn mine daily and I haven't had any issues with it.  My only complaint is I wish they made them for multiple daughters (more than two).  I had to buy another set for mom/one daughter.,4,246
It is a Christmas gift.,4,23
"Cute but order a size of two up. Thin material so you will need a cami under it. Also careful if you are a little larger with the ladies, might not button all the way.",4,167
"My boyfriend absolutely loves the watch. He said it looks sexy and that it's comfortable feeling. But it did not come with the necessary tools to adjust the watch. If it did, this would've been a 5 stars. If you have the necessary tools to adjust good hell yeah but the watch.",4,276
Smaller than on photo,4,21
There was a nice one based on it s price.<br />but it was too large for me.<br />the chest and breast part was larger than the bottom part and i had to return it.,4,162
I wear a medium but this would have been better in a large.  It is very pretty and I am planning on wearing it as a beach cover up so I am keeping it.,4,150
"My 6 year old daughter prefers this mask to others. She can also take it on and off by herself. It doesn’t bother her ears, and she can wear it for several hours outside without complaining. Cute design.  Not 5 stars because it is kind of expensive for two pieces of fabric.",4,274
"I like the color which complements most skin tones, even mine!",4,62
It wasn't the color advertized,4,30
A very nice quality belt.  It is exactly what I was looking for.,4,64
"I normally wear size M, but needed an XL for a slim fit. It's a great looking shirt and very flattering to wear. I would give it five stars but for the fact that the material is not entirely comfortable, but it is nice a stretchy.",4,230
Bought these for my daughter to wear to the beach. They fit well and worked great.,4,82
I was afraid they wouldn't fit him. But they fit perfectly. Couldn't give a 5-star because I haven't had to wash them yet...fingers crossed,4,139
I like the way it looks on the wife.,4,36
"A little faded when arrived. Stitching was done well but not straight at some spots. Other than that, very beautiful from a view an arms length away.",4,149
The coat is very cute and look mostly as pictured except for the firm trim. It is not at all thick and fluffy as shown in the picture.,4,134
"She really liked it, thought it clever!",4,39
"Tighter fit, but very breathable.",4,33
Good value for the price!  Ran a little on the large side,4,57
Muy lindo me encanto.gracias amazon mi tienda favorita.,4,55
"Great product my only problem is with the buckle it came apart shortly after purchased, although an inconvenience, since I own a workshop I was able to do a repair using a small nail as the pin.",4,194
Love the belt. Prongs a quite stiff but belt material is great. Had to wait over a month for delivery but relieved it finally came.,4,131
Good quality but I was unable to use the ring it came with because the ball was too tight of a fit. But otherwise great!,4,120
Seam split on finger...  company was very quick in responding and correcting the issue!,4,87
Love love love the shoes...laces are my only issue...come untied all of the time,4,80
Really cute little pin. I gave it to a friend who loves shoes.  Nice quality and cheap price. Looks just like the picture!,4,122
Nice bag but not that easy to lock. I have been pulling the straps in and out to loosen it up some. Still difficult to get the locking loop exposed. The locking feature is nice if you need that.,4,194
I love these boots they are so cute and comfortable. However the little pull on strap on the heel ripped off when I was putting them on one time. I don’t mind the look without them so it wasn’t a big deal for me I just hope the rest of the boots hold up!,4,254
"My mom is a size 12/14 but had to return the 14 , too small. Size 16 fit her well... You must order up in size.. Nice material.",4,127
I think these are super comfortable but their description is not accurate. There is no fleece.  These are just regular leggings.  Good for winter inside but I would never be warm enough outdoors.  I would actually sleep in these.,4,229
"Gave 4 stars only because I had to wear something underneath. The buttons stopped so high up and they’re pretty loose so you can see all down the middle of the dress. Other than that, I love it. It fits true to size and is a lighter fabric.",4,240
Just as expected and wife loves them,4,36
"These were shinny, for what I paid I really enjoyed them",4,56
Love the dress but it’s absolutely not for petite women.,4,56
"Yes, it fits and look good on my wrist.  Will order again.  Thanks",4,66
These Keyes are amazing! But I feel as though there are a little to small abut other than that a great product to buy go display for fairytale fans. The price is also great for what you get. I enjoyed this product very much.,4,224
"For sizes 10-12, buy XXL.  Very nice dress.",4,43
"Great bag-- pretty and well made!  Wish the zipper was set in the purse a bit differently-- cannot zip with one hand. Overall, very happy with this purchase and feel it will be pretty and durable longer term!",4,208
I like them but the are very snug for my junk..,4,47
My daughters teacher loved this gift.,4,37
"Built in light works well enough but it's not the best. Otherwise great simple watch, exactly what I was looking for.",4,117
The belt is awesome. The only reason I gave it a four star is because the size adjuster is a little difficult to get to though your belt loops.,4,143
So pretty but the heart fell off during first time use.  Was still able to function it and clip it where I needed but I could see how this could be an issue for some customers.,4,176
Just right size for my needs.,4,29
I received the island paradise color. I did not find it to be see through.  It is very cute and comfortable.  I liked that you can wear it with an open back or tied.<br />I did notice it does get wrinkled if you don't pull it straight from the dryer.,4,250
"I'm a skinny man, and the cape barely fits my neck",4,50
Really cute and fun print,4,25
These are so cute & super comfy!!! I measured my foot and based on inches chose to not get the large but wish I did. I'm a perfect size 8 shoe and these are good to a tiny bit tight without socks. They have a nice bottom though and are super cute & soft. I do love them!!!!!,4,274
"I truly like the softness of the material, but was hoping for a material that was a little thinner.",4,99
very nice packaging and just as pictured.,4,41
I really love these leggings! They are comfortable and cute enough to wear outside of the gym. I would definitely buy again. I took away one star because unfortunately you can see through them a little when you bend down. It's not bad enough for me to stop wearing them though!,4,277
"The shoes themselves are very nice, but they were a little too big for me (I use the same size for every pair of Lacoste shoes I have and never had a problem).",4,159
Gives great push up but its not true to the size you usually would use.Pick a size up and you should be fine,4,108
"Love Amanda Jeans. Great fit . Boot cut a little wider than I thought , but very nice!",4,86
Husband loved it. Fits great,4,28
Supper cute just a little smaller than expected.,4,48
"It's short but I wear undershirts so that's not a big problem for me but it'll shrink more if you ain't careful about how you wash it, other than that yeah itsit's just your average polo",4,186
"Like these a lot, though they are slightly see through.  Need to wear nude colored underwear with these.",4,104
a little heavier than i expected. but warm.,4,43
They just run a bit small but work very well.,4,45
"There were a little small, but I loved them so much I'll order another pair, just 2 sizes bigger this time.",4,107
It was light way and perfect fit.  Colors are bright and cheerful.,4,66
This bracelet looks great.  Only wish is that they did a better job with lobster claw clasp and connecting ring.  The finish is not as nice as bracelet and it is not aligned correctly and my bracelet twists near the clasp rather than lying flat.  For the money this is a great deal.,4,282
These sandals look right and fit correctly. I just would have liked them to be a bit more padded for a more comfortable walk.,4,125
"I wore this with my bat costume. It was cute, but it was a little too narrow and occluded my vision so I didn’t wear it the whole day. I wish the eye holes were a little larger. Quality is pretty good.",4,201
I love the fit and they are so comfortable. The only thing that I did not expect was the material. It was thinner than I expected.,4,130
Bought this for my husband Good quality product fit is true to size washes very well retains shape even with drying in dryer<br />We are  please with product,4,157
Love the item for the price! The glasses are a little larger than I had anticipated but they are still cute with a top knot or some retro garb. Planning on getting prescription lenses put in so that I can actually see! :),4,221
"The socks are great and when I wore them at this event, It was very comfortable. I just have to say that the material feels a bit weird and because I have larger legs, it didn't fit in some areas. It slid down a few times, so I had to constantly pull them back up. Overall, great product though!",4,295
"Un excelente producto para el precio que tiene. El color no es tan intenso como en la foto, pero está bien. En general, las medidas son las correctas, aunque se estira un poco, no mucho. Tengan esto en cuenta.",4,209
"I ordered one of these dresses from another company, and the quality was a little better from them.  This one is lighter weight, but it is also shorter than the other one, so it is being used as a tunic instead of a dress.<br />Overall, it's a nice shirt.",4,255
Christmas gift,4,14
It's bright orange like traffic cones. Pic makes it look like a muted orange.,4,77
Not doubled sided,4,17
Great simple bathingsuit. I am 5'3 110 pounds and the small fit perfectly. Material doesn't look cheap. I would buy again,4,121
Beautiful dress! Classy,4,23
Super cute and fits just right.  The only reason for 4 stars is because it absorbs smells.  I work a grill from time to time and the band smells like it.  I’ve washed it with fragrant soap and hit it with clear dry shampoo but the smell never goes away.  Will try some febreeze next...,4,285
I was looking for a new Michigan shirt to wear for sporting events. This shirt fits good but the quality is okay. It wasn't totally what I was expecting when it came in the mail. I worry as time goes on the material may fall apart. I will be careful how much I wash this shirt.,4,277
Description said 22/20 MM Assumed it tapered from 22 down to 20 at the clasp - it didn't.  Assumed the perforations went all the way through the band - they didn't.  Just a junior-scale watch band thus the low rating.  Still going to use the band until something more appropriate comes along.,4,292
Size was little big but was perfect after putting in dryer. Very very soft,4,74
Really cute kinda short,4,23
"LOVE the look and exterior of this purse; the inside leaves much to be desired, cheap lining and lack of interior pockets.",4,122
Pants are larger than expected,4,30
The fabric for these jammies are very soft! I’m 5’3” and the length was perfect for me. I don’t like baggy jammies as I feel like I get caught up in them at night. I will say the waistband was a bit bulkier and tighter than I expected. I’m at size 0/2 in pants and felt the squeeze a bit.,4,288
Not as cute as the pictures but ok.,4,35
"The quality of this product is outstanding, I just am not excited about how it sits on the ear and looks.",4,105
"Pricey, bit they don't rip easily as other do.",4,46
Fits great nice jumpsuit for the price,4,38
"The top arrived in less than a week. The material was soft and smooth, however, the top was fairly snug. I am a US 2X-3X so I ordered a 3x. Fits more like a 1X-2X.",4,163
So cute love it,4,15
I used this for a new year's Eve party. It goes great with jeans,4,64
"Haven't worn the skirt yet, but I like the style and color.",4,59
"They are a bit too long for my leg and I wish they had a bit more compression to them, but overall they are good quality for the price.",4,135
Multiple colors,4,15
Very pretty. I bought it as a gift.,4,35
Very nice. Good watch for the price.,4,36
Good looking belt but not as durable as I had hoped. Certainly worth the price. Seller was great.,4,97
"Fast shipping top area larger than I expected,  but love, material design",4,73
They are fine. This was my first purchase of earrings in a long time. Still getting use to the new style. But they live up to what I ordered.,4,141
Fits great on my 10 year old. Cute and safe at the same time. Breathable & comfortable. Great for outside while not having to wear a mask.,4,138
Great bag. Well made and solid. Wish it were a little larger but it holds quite a bit. I would recommend it.,4,108
Decent leggings for the price. Very thin but full coverage. Tummy control is ok but band constantly rolls down.<br /><br />Has an emblem on the left leg. I washed inside out to preserve it. Unsure how long it'll hold up but will post update if it doesn't hold up after a few washings!,4,284
"Daughter likes them, but I'm not happy about the flowers coming off so easily. Especially with younger children in the house who would find then on the floor.",4,158
The color is pretty but is a little bit small,4,45
Really cute and flattering cut. However it rides up super easy and becomes very short.,4,86
Era lo que quería..,4,19
Great colorful sweater. Love the texture of the fabric.,4,55
the shorts are a bit see through,4,32
"They are cute but the turquoise ball is a little bit on the big side bigger than what the picture of the depicts, I wear it for work, it adds to the professional classy look.",4,174
Nice looking item! I like it so far. Came on time and fits well. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of style.,4,125
"It's cute but definitely not as full as the pic. Fits great. I am 5'9 and an extra large (36DDD). Only REAL downside, is that the stripes don't match at the seems, which is a bit annoying, but i like the top a lot (and was pleasantly surprised by a garment coming from Korea). It's a keeper.",4,291
This isn't the most flattering dress on me.,4,43
Holy crap this thing is creepy to look at but my daughter loves it. For the kind of thin plastic it's made of I honestly think it shouldn't be $8 but oh well. Otherwise it's what I was looking for and wasn't too expensive.,4,222
Its a nice bathing suit. I just have a long torso and it fit kinda small,4,72
So far I haves Used it once it was alright it cost a bit for what it dose but good product,4,90
Much thinner than I thought but over all was a nice purchase,4,60
Looks longer in picture but still looks good,4,44
"I really like the material, but can't seem to find a tag saying what kind of fabric?",4,84
It’s a bit small but I like it. Kinda see through but it is breathable and stretchy with adjustable straps.,4,107
A little jumbled up and you need someone else to put it on but it's groovy.,4,75
it is fine,4,10
The medium is a little too big the small it's ok,4,48
They are just what I needed.  It saved me hundreds of dollars by not having to buy prescription sunglasses.,4,107
"I bought two dresses in two different colors the first one fit perfect. The second  one came a little big, but the corset ties in the back worked to fix that. All together perfect dress for the event.",4,200
"Good.,,",4,7
Great Mickey Mouse design. Not super soft.,4,42
The chain that comes with this necklace is very delicate and small in length.  My mom loved it,4,94
The belt is just the right size and is holding up well.,4,55
Not crazy about the clasp.,4,26
These were a little bigger than we expected so they fall off more easily than I'd like. However our kiddo walks in them just fine and they're a great summer shoe for splash pads.,4,178
Haven't used it yet. Looks pretty nice.,4,39
"Bigger than I thought, super cool! I thought you would click and light would stay on but it’s only on if You’re pressing down",4,125
They fit great and look great o me,4,34
"Love the color, love the fit.",4,29
"These socks are great for me. They are thicker than most compression socks, they feel like good cotton socks not thin elastic socks  I like them",4,144
"Jewelry look beautiful. Ring could’ve had a little more bandwidth. Other than that, I like the jewelry.",4,103
It was a bday gift for my niece.  It was larger than I thought but she still likes it.,4,86
"I liked the  quality, better than what I expected.<br />Definitely would recommend.",4,83
"Love the quality, just a bit on the large side.",4,47
My wife likes it it’s very good product and looks beautiful on her,4,66
"Very nice and confortable frames,the only thing is that the grey color is much darker than in the picture,they're almost black",4,126
Me encantan solo una pequeña marchita fuera de lugar,4,52
I really like this dress it is so nice and the material is great! Definitely well made.<br />I gave it 4 starts because I thought the buttons made the dresses look cheaper. However it was nice so I kept it and it was worth adding different buttons.,4,248
Almost too small,4,16
Very pretty and well made. My daughter loved it!,4,48
"they are a little bulky, but otherwise they work really well and stay on tight. I would reorder this item if needed.",4,116
nice pin,4,8
It's ok nothing spectacular 3,4,29
"Nice set, but tie and tie tack are on the chinsy side.",4,54
Awesome gift,4,12
"more than $ 10, I would not take. Beautiful",4,43
This shirt is super comfortable and very soft to the touch. I found that the size fit pretty close to the sizing chart. I got the light gray shirt and did not have to wear any tank tops under neath. I will probably buy some more in other colors!,4,245
Praise dancing,4,14
"Lovely dress! Fit and color as expected, the fabric is thinner than expected but nothing I would rate as a complaint.",4,117
"It was a very nice dress. It was short, and I'm 5'2, (I ordered an XL) but I am very curvy so that added another element to it. Over all good buy.<br />I would definitely recommend.",4,181
"Like it, however the style lines are a little off when you wrap it. Nice material and weight. Not too bad for the price and went well with my plauge mask.",4,154
These are really cute. Very soft and stretchy.,4,46
Stone popped out. it won't happen again. I super glued it.,4,58
The necklace was larger than I expected.,4,40
"They're great for the price, but 2 came w/ aberrations where the stickers were.",4,79
"A friend told me about these, so I ordered a pair. I always have been a firm supporter in Keens for work. But I have to say these are just as good, but not the high price tag. I will be buying another pair of these in a different color!!",4,237
super cute but a little snug... should order a size up.,4,55
I gave to my friend as a present. She wore it just fine.,4,56
These fit my man great. I need some too but they are not quite feminine enough for me,4,85
"Tried it on. Ordered my typical size. Very pretty color. The sleeves were a bit tight and the body of the shirt were a bit loose. Made in and shipped from China, so takes a long time to be delivered.",4,199
"Loved the design and more in person, but just not liking how they can get easily loose.",4,87
"These seem like good quality.  Using the information provided, I hoped they would be large enough for my husband.  He is 6 ft. and 190 pounds.  They are too small for him, but I plan on using to snorkel in Hawaii, as they fit me well.  I am 5' 5&#34; and weigh 135 pounds.",4,272
This hat served the purpose. It was comfortable. I wore it to a funeral. I would buy it again.,4,94
Just around the house.,4,22
"Very nice, but after all, they are rubbery plastic.  You get what you pay for. However, they look better than you would expect.",4,127
3 year old loves them!,4,22
A little oversized but works for kids.,4,38
"Great Glasses.  The lenses are a little difficult to change, but the glasses fit great and the low-light lenses are exceptional for early/late golf rounds.<br />They are sourced from the UK, so I was a little surprised when I saw the delivery dates.",4,249
Very cute. Just smaller than I expected.,4,40
I love these for running - especially love the drawstring.  They are a bit more snug than my normal size though.  I bought one size bigger than I normally wear.,4,160
"This is a very comfortable dress, but when I washed it it shrunk a lot. I think it’s 4 “ shorter. I’m going to try to iron it out to see if it makes a difference.",4,162
Love this belt! Wear it to work where I am constantly moving around and also use it for snowboarding. The flex is great and comfortable for moving around but still fits perfectly snug. Was happy they had a skinnier width but wish they had more color and design options for women!,4,279
I gave the green camouflage to my husband from the pack. He has allergies and got a bad allergy outbreak after wearing this. I washed it along with the others and they are fine now,4,180
These fit my small face really well. They are a bit awkward around my ears but it's something I can put up with. I wear them daily.,4,131
"Nice set, but some of the links were coming loose, i had to fix.",4,64
Cute!!! A little big but can be dressed up or down.,4,51
A little bit smaller would be better but can put it in my levi front pocket and it is well protected.,4,101
"It fit nice and felt comfy but this is like Shein quality, but not a Shein price so I returned it.",4,98
"Nice ring, I had bought in the wrong size the first time. So I put it on a necklace and bought a new one. Fits good and doesn't scratch up to easy.",4,147
"Love the extra pockets but I could not fit all of the stuff they claim to fit into the bag.  Its a bit smaller when you get it, the strap is a bit short as well",4,160
"This dress came yesterday and I am happy to say, it fits, it's light, it's adorable! I love it! I'm usually a US small,  boy am I glad I read the reviews because it does run small! I got a Medium and it fits perfect.",4,216
made christmas gifts for my coworkers and they loved them.,4,58
Very nice shoes little hard to get on sometimes but I do recommend them.  Have received lots of compliments!,4,108
The people in my ANG unit loves them!,4,37
For what you pay these are well worth it! They have gpod quality and are even cuter in person.<br />Only complaint is sizing. The 0-3 is huge more like a 3-6 in sizing.,4,168
Is exactly what I expected.,4,27
Bien lindo,4,10
Looks cute but way to thin no option to use filters which would thicken product and fit better,4,94
"This necklace is so long it almost at my waist level which hids the climax of the necklace, the stone! So I will have to put the stone on a better necklace to give it a better shine.",4,182
I love it but after a while there are black/grey streaks in the gold. But I love it. I bought two for each arm.,4,111
These bracelets are made much better than I expected. The beading is also much tinier than I expected. Overall would recommend and will probably buy more.,4,154
Comfortable and lightweight.  These shorts are true to size.<br />The fabric has a nice stretch to it but I did notice  a small snag after wearing them a couple times. It's not so severe you couldn't wear it again but was hoping they would be more durable.,4,256
I was really pleased with the fit of this dress and I LOVE the pockets.<br />The fabric isn’t the most luxurious but it is silky-ish and comfortable. The only complaint I have is that if it stretches the fabric becomes a little see through. Just plan to wear a dark bra if you’re well endowed.,4,293
very narrow,4,11
"These earrings are stunning.  Beautiful quality, and well made.  Unfortunately, I had to return them because they were a little too heavy for my elderly ears.  Otherwise, I would have kept them.",4,194
NOT FOR BIG CHESTED WOMEN. I always wore with a bralette under it because it slips down with dancing. I’m a 36 DD. Also pills after several washes,4,146
Ok but don’t like sleeves,4,25
Very fashionable but man kill the plastic smell... it’s ruining my vibe,4,71
"These are ok. They're not as warm as I wanted...but they fit perfectly on this 5'3"",140lb body. And I can't see through them while wearing them.",4,144
boy do kids love these things,4,29
Fit perfectly wish it was more low cut but it’s very cheeky and flattering,4,74
Nice shirt fits smaller than expected.,4,38
"Super comfy, attractive dress. I like where it fell for a little more modest look- just below my knees. I am 5’3” and 125 and ordered a small. It was just a tad big in the waist, but still super comfy and I will be buying more in other patterns.",4,245
"I like this dress for every day wear. I wish the cotton was little thicker. It was hard to find a bra that wasn’t seen through the breast area, but if I would have sized up, the dress would have been huge.",4,205
"I ordered a medium...normally a 2.  It's a little larger in the waist, but fits well in the hips.  It's cute but the fabric is a little cheesy",4,142
I didn't dislike the product I just needed to return two,4,56
"Kid like it a lot, just a bit larger",4,36
"I love these skirts. They ride up a bit, but the fabric is soft and comfortable.",4,80
Nice fitted jacket. Don't let the light weight fool you. It is very warm!!,4,74
"I'm a classic RayBan fan, but I keep losing or destroying those expensive glasses. Was looking for a low cost alternative but with the same retro cool look. These zeroUV's have done the job.",4,190
Not as off shoulder as the picture shows,4,40
"I ordered a small, but could have ordered an extra small.  I still love the outfit and think it is very cute.  The material is not lightweight.  So if you don't want to iron it, just take it to the cleaners to have it pressed after you have washed it.",4,251
Arrived on schedule nice and lit of stuff you can put on..<br />Satisfied customer here..,4,89
"153 pounds 5ft 5"" ordered a large, was too big. Going to return for a medium.",4,77
A little tight around edge causing some redness on foot - expect them to stretch a bit - otherwise they are perfect!,4,116
I like how these gloves are lightweight and easy to grip things with. The touchscreen feature was an essential. The fit is excellent.,4,133
so far so good the material is quite stretchy and fit my sister perfectly,4,73
Nice and soft. A little heavy for a summer nightshirt.,4,54
"Fits true to size and very comfortable. Does not feel like your traditional bathing suit, it’s very soft and feels like it would retain a lot of water. But it wasn’t too bad",4,173
Would have given 5 stars but is less protective than I had expected. Other than that it is fine.,4,96
I guess too big is better than too small,4,40
Love the bracelet. It broke after a while because it kept getting caught in clothing.,4,85
Very cute! GREAT price!,4,23
Had been searching all over and found this. Love it!,4,52
Will probably be sturdy & durable. Toddler sneaker.,4,51
Very cute print Granddaughter will love it. Anything “Marie” is a win,4,69
Very nice shoe. They run two sizes too big though.,4,50
Very large bag and once the smell was gone it was nice.,4,55
The chest is a bit tight but has a little stretch so if your big busted you may want to get a bigger size. But I think if I would have it would have been too big.,4,162
The bowtie broke immediately but still worth getting!,4,53
Dress is beautiful but a little snug at the chest. I can still wear it but I usually don’t wear snug clothing. I’ll keep it and wear for special occasions,4,154
"Pretty dress, little snug. And would look better on taller person",4,65
"This is a cute top. However, the material isn’t as stretchy as I would like for yoga",4,84
Love the hat but was smashed in packaging.,4,42
Very cute sandal.  Arrived earlier than expected.,4,49
Doesn’t come with tights which is disappointing. The bottoms are flattering but I wish they were more cheeky.,4,109
I ordered a size up ( 11 instead of 10 ) and they fit just right. The sole is non-marking on my laminate floors. We will see how they hold up over time.,4,152
"I loved the fit of my new romper. The waist fits a little low, but thats just fine.  All in all, great value, comfort and style, all good.",4,138
This is a cute charm but for some reason it is very hard to attach to the charm bracelet.  Much more difficult than most of the other charms that I bought.  But other than that I am happy with it.,4,196
We purchased this for a variety show. It was just fine.  A bit thin but pretty.,4,79

"I did as suggested and ordered a larger size and it is slightly small, but fits and closes",4,90
Overall I really liked this necklace it was very Beautiful but it wasn’t what I expected the packaging it very pretty but the necklace wasn’t that big.,4,151
Great for night rides on the motorcycle and for sneak attacks on unsuspecting friends.  I recommend this headgear.  Wear it proudly.,4,132
"I was looking for a longer skirt to cover everything while I was pregnant and this fit the bill. Now that I'm back to normal, it is just a bit too long for my taste. I am 5'2'' with normal proportions and it comes down to mid calf.",4,231
"Helps with my plantar fasciitis and my tired feet at end of the day. The only problem is the pair I ordered are too large, (so order size down), but after wearing them I didn’t want to be without them to return. Will eventually order a smaller size.",4,249
"The sizes are way too small. Almost about one and a half size smaller than expected. Yet when u go up a size, the shoe still fits oddly.",4,136
Exactly as pictured.,4,20
"Gorgeous dress, but runs really small. Not just in one area either...the entire dress. So disappointed cause the dress is beautiful. I'm even wondering if it was just tagged incorrectly.",4,186
Love this dress. Fits great! The one thing that was disappointed about was one of the pockets wasn't stich right so it had a hole. But other then that it a great dress.,4,168
This is a pretty decent selection of beads if you are looking for an assortment this is definitely that I had none that matched,4,127
"Pretty watch love the look of it. However, the battery died an hour after I started it.<br /><br />Due to the watch being faulty,  I was offered a replacement which has been working great. This company strives to make their customers happy.",4,240
Gift recipient loved this.,4,26
Seam is  crooked if patches are on elbows.,4,42
its okay but the texture isn't what I wanted.,4,45
I've had them a while now and like them. I do feel like they are starting to stretch and not fit as snug. For the price I can't really complain.,4,144
Fits abit large. But a good shoe nonetheless.,4,45
"this is a very good value.  the frames are a bit thin and the glass area a little smaller than i most prefer. For spreading  around the house it is a<br />good item for good convenience.  Nicely packaged , too.",4,210

have not had chance to try them at night yet. I hope the polarized lens makes oncoming headlights dimmer.,4,105
Nice quality though the fit is tighter than it ought to be. Based on this I bought a second pair which fit perfectly.  The quality is better than other gloves I've purchased,4,173
"It fits well in the body but ran a bit short for me. It hits around my ankles. Next time I'll size up.  Its also a bit see through, I always wear a cami or shirt when I wear the dress.",4,184
Serves it's purpose.,4,20
Feather light. Soft around the neck.,4,36
bigger  and more tubular than I thought from description and picture,4,68
"Runs a size small, i normally wear a small, ordered a medium and the fit is perfect. Great price for a cute swimsuit",4,116
"The shirt itself is nice, its soft and comfortable. The only reason I gave it a 4 is it ran just a little small, otherwise I love it. Plus it arrived on time",4,157
This is a great pendant and I love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the chain is a bit thick and heavy for a woman's chain and it is already getting tarnished.,4,174
The pins were in good condition. Came on time.  Variety of pins was great.  Kids loved trading at Disney. No duplicates as promised,4,131
Color more red than wine,4,24
Cute dress fits well,4,20

They are very nice But they are thinner than I thought. I can see right through them.<br />I would have given them 5 stars if they were thicker!,4,144

Good fabric although needs ironing/steaming when you get it.  Recommend steaming.,4,81
"Like most have said, it can be too short. I added a ruffle at thebottom because with my shoes it was too short.",4,111
lighter sweatshirt material I have a larger bust so every thing fits tight there but love this sweatshirt! so comfortable,4,121

I loved DBZ as a kid and could not resist purchasing this shirt because who doesn't want to work out like a Saiyan?? It fits a more snug than I was expecting but it looks good on me. I have no complaints. Maybe buy a size up if you like some baggage in your clothing.,4,267
You'll definitely get spotted in this leopard print headband. Made of crushed velvet it features the turban like cross over twist. It is not a turban but a head band with a twist. It is quite comfortable on and I adore the print and soft fabric. It is a chic remedy for a bad hair day.,4,285
"Beautiful dress. It is inexpensively made, but for the price I didn't expect much. It runs a little small, but it's still very nice. The colors are true and vibrant.",4,165

fixs well,4,9
"I don't mind the actual watch itself, but the band is not my favorite.",4,70

"This is the perfect size! Bought for travel but ended up using it every day.  Adjustable strap, zippered outside pockets for keys and phone and inside is spacious enough to carry all essentials.  Grey is a great neutral cooler that looks great with any outfit.",5,260
